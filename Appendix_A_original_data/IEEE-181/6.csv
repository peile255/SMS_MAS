It is critical to control all the agents by using protocols that describe the interaction of agents and the environment in a top-down approach. We introduce a system that uses interaction protocol descriptions and has the capability of controlling hundreds of thousands of agents. This makes it feasible to realize a mega-scale navigation system that can assist the inhabitants of a small city. In developing a massively multiagent system, protocol design and agent development need to be separated to allow specialists to work in concert with one another while honing the different technologies. As a platform for mega-scale navigation system, we devise an architecture for multiagent platforms where the execution of agents scenario and the implementation of agents are explicitly separated. This paper also gives the evaluation and an application example using the platform.","","0-7695-2673-X","10.1109/SKG.2006.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5727663","","","","4","","8","IEEE","20 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This crowd simulation will be used to make intelligent agents which can find the best path during the situation of any disaster and show humans the safest path which the humans can follow to get to the nearest safe points. Multiagent simulation, commonly referred to as a Crowd and Agent Simulation, is an approach used to simulate many people, animals or other characters interacting with each other in one place. These actors are expected to pursue their objectives, engage in the environment and coordinate with each other. It is expected that the simulated actors will pursue their goals, interact with the environment, and communicate among themselves.

However, the heterogeneous nature of edge servers (ESs) and the single-destination offloading strategy may limit the overall network performance. In this case, tasks are exclusively handled by the administrative ES, resulting in only marginal improvements in service quality, such as energy consumption and task delay. To fully exploit the advantages of edge computing, this article investigates the cooperation among ESs within CPSS and proposes a cooperative algorithm, named MATORA, to exploit a further performance gain by calculating the task offloading and resource allocation decisions. First, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a time-varying mixed integer nonlinear programming problem; then, we utilize the multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to learn the action policy. Second, the MATORA novelly builds reputation model for each ES to obtain insightful knowledge based on service quality, enhancing the training efficiency of MADRL. Thirdly, we simulate a digital twin-based virtual system to monitor the physical network, in which a risk-free, centralized training environment is provided for the multiagent algorithm.

Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas-simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2560882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463035","Complexity;fidelity;level of detail artificial intelligence (LOD AI);multiagent systems;multiobjective optimization","Complexity theory;Multi-agent systems;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Learning systems;Games","","12","","36","IEEE","29 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is challenging to make optimal resource allocation and offloading decisions due to the mobility, ubiquitous communications, and diverse resource demands of SVs and the dynamic nature of the vehicular network topology. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation and task offloading scheme for HAPS-assisted Internet of Vehicle networks by exploiting the potential of digital twins (DT), blockchain, and federated multiagent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL) technologies to address these issues. The DT network is utilized to intelligently monitor and control the demand and supply of resources in the digital representation of the physical operating environment. We adopt a dynamic pricing-based double auction to model the supplies and demands of resource providers and requesters. This enables resource providers and SVs to make adaptive and optimal resource allocation and task offloading decisions. In addition, we deploy a consortium blockchain to enable distributed and secure resource allocation. The resource allocation and task offloading multi-objective optimization problem is formulated as a multiagent extension of the Markov decision process and solved using an FMADRL-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FMADDPG) algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme archives efficient resource allocation and maximizes the utility function while minimizing costs compared to the baseline schemes.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2024.3492015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10742925","Blockchain;digital twin;resource allocation;task offloading;smart vehicles;deep reinforcement learning;federated learning;double auction","Resource management;Computational modeling;Blockchains;Security;Vehicle dynamics;Real-time systems;Digital twins;Dynamic scheduling;Data privacy;Data models","","3","","","IEEE","5 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As highly computerized avatars of vehicular metaverse users (VMUs), the vehicle twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy.

However, authoring complicated interactions between multiple actors in a way that balances control flexibility and automation remains a considerable challenge. A proposed behavior-authoring framework gives users complete control over the domain of the system: the state space, action space, and cost of executing actions. To specialize actors, the framework uses effect and cost modifiers, which modify existing action definitions, and constraints, which prune action choices in a state-dependent manner. The framework groups actors with common or conflicting goals to form a composite domain, and a multiagent planner generates complicated interactions between multiple actors. The Web extra is a video that shows how multiactor simulations should aim to strike a happy medium between the automation of generation and the flexibility of specification.","1558-1756","","10.1109/MCG.2011.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963624","crowds;high-level behaviors;coordination;authoring;virtual worlds;computer graphics;graphics and multimedia","Virtual environments;Trajectory;Computational modeling;Video communication","Artificial Intelligence;Automobiles;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Crowding;Humans","35","","2","IEEE","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Balanced against the advantages of the VR-DT service, its data-driven, computing-intensive, and security-sensitive features bring challenges to the current IIoT. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed resource allocation scheme to improve the average Quality of Service (QoS) of the VR-DT services with regard to service delay and transaction throughput. We formulate the joint optimization of channel assignment, subframe configuration, computing capacity allocation, and block size adjustment as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A fully decentralized multiagent compound-action actor–critic algorithm is developed to solve the QoS optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can efficiently improve the average QoS of the VR-DT services in a realizable way as compared to existing schemes.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3224986","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62025105,62201104,U21B2005,62201104); Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:CXQT21019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964320","Blockchain;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);digital twin (DT);multiagent;virtual reality (VR)","Industrial Internet of Things;Digital twins;Resource management;Optimization;Blockchains;Quality of service;Computational modeling","","13","","24","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, deploying a single large drone might not be efficient for completing tasks compared to the use of a heterogeneous swarm of smaller and lighter drones, which can better adapt to different application scenarios and reduce the mission time. In this sense, Search and Rescue (SAR) activities represent an important field of application. Heterogeneous multiagent systems require ad-hoc Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) algorithms to effectively manage the agents of the swarm. Hence, there is a need for an efficient simulator that allows for the validation of such GNC techniques, taking advantage of the positive aspects of a risk-free virtual environment before realworld deployment. In this sense, the main aim of this paper is to propose a heterogeneous Simulink-based multi-agent flight simulator that is able to support researchers in the representation of realistic scenarios before effectively conducting real tests. The effectiveness of the proposed simulator, which is part of the project “CHeMSys: Cooperative Heterogeneous Multi-drone System for disaster prevention and first response,” is evaluated in several scenarios, considering ground, water, and air vehicles.","","979-8-3315-0558-5","10.1109/TechDefense63521.2024.10863312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10863312","coordinated feasible trajectory planning;multirobot systems;surveillance missions;set-theoretic approach","Visualization;Prevention and mitigation;Disasters;Virtual environments;Mathematical models;Environmental factors;Trajectory;MATLAB;Vehicle dynamics;Drones","","","","25","IEEE","7 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, building scenarios related to the growing of existent slums, the birth of new ones, and their evolution, would be very useful for urban planning and for the elaboration of social policies aiming to minimize the impact caused by the uncontrolled growing of slums.","2164-7151","978-0-7695-2976-9","10.1109/ISDA.2007.76","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4389723","","Cities and towns;Aerodynamics;Predictive models;Africa;Intelligent systems;Intelligent agent;Multiagent systems;Computational modeling;Information systems;Visualization","","1","","13","IEEE","27 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, a new method based on COllective INtelligence(COIN) which presented by NASA/Ames research center is proposed. Firstly, a hierarchical model is defined which expand the conventional COIN framework to the heterogeneous multi-agent system; then the forms and the constructing process of the global utility constructed by the hierarchical model are discussed. Secondly, based on an air defense scenario where weapons(agents) needed to assign to the targets without centralized control, a concrete world utility is constructed to solve the rapid self-response of agents. Finally, the impacting factors, effect set, which impacting the coordination effect of the system are discussed.

Tailor-made mechanisms are engaging in the light of disputes to resolve emerging contradictions between the atoms. Most of the dominant blockchain architectures tend to oversee this fact. They come integrated with rigid, overkilling consensus-achievement procedures, which, in many cases, are not necessary or significantly beneficial. They often raise overwhelming demands on the nodes and prohibit the deployment of fully distributed and peer blockchain operation in the IoT world. Still, for the IoT ecosystems and the metaverse to become self-sustainable and self-evolving, robust validity mechanisms must be embedded in the atomic scale. This work investigates the process of building and sustaining scalable consensus policies over the trivial atomic capacities of the IoT ecosystems. For this, we deploy the IoT microblockchain framework as an atomic consistency tier and we define a primary set of validity rules that every node can easily carry out. The initial concept relies on Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and K. Friston’s free energy principle and is investigated under the perspectives of graph and game theory. To study the dynamic behavior of the system, a competitive game among the nodes is run. The Proof of Existence (PoE) is utilized as a universal proofing case. Its feasibility is demonstrated, and its complexity is analyzed under various system considerations. The findings prove that finite-capacity atoms can collectively and efficiently support verifiable validity and scalable consensus in the evolutionary IoT ecosystems and the metaverse, even under conditions of high diversity, trivial capacity, and eventual consistency.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3162103","Project “Immersive Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality Center Of Epirus”(grant numbers:MIS 5047221); Action “Reinforcement of the Research and Innovation Infrastructure,”; Operational Programme “Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation” (NSRF 2014–2020) and co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9741249","Artificial intelligence (AI)-intensive multiagent systems;evolutionary systems;IoT microblockchain;IoT sustainable transactional trust;peer IoT ecosystems;rational metaverse;reality modeling;scalable consensus;validity in IoT ecosystems","Peer-to-peer computing;Blockchains;Ecosystems;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Computer architecture;Computational intelligence","","6","","28","IEEE","24 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We deploy the belief-desire-intention (BDI) concept to model our agents. Whereas most works in the field assume perfect information, we take into account the bounded rationality characteristics of human beings into the perception of agents. We found that the increasing number of agents affects the performance by increasing duration, number of rounds, duration per round, duration per agent, and round per agent in two dense scenes. However, the perception process added on does not directly affect the performance of the algorithm. With regards to the behavior of the agents, we found that most agents are affected by the increasing number of agents that their paths divert significantly from the original plan. However, there are some agents which apparently can maintain their paths close to their original ones.","","978-1-5090-2258-8","10.1109/ACDT.2016.7437651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437651","agent-based simulation;crowd simulation","Collision avoidance;Mobile communication;Planning;Buildings;Sun;Generators;Joining processes","","1","","10","IEEE","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
