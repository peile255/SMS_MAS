It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2020.2998530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9120192","Artificial intelligence (AI);business models;cyber physical systems (CPSs);digital twin (DT);Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning (ML);multiagent systems;network function virtualization;sensors;servitization;smart city;software architecture;softwarization;virtual and augmented reality","Internet of Things;Cloning;Digital twin;Software engineering;Solid modeling;Software architecture;Manufacturing processing","","514","","293","IEEE","18 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sensing and sensory data interpretation play ever increasing role because sensing becomes the primary way of collecting information about the environment. In the most challenging cases the environment is unstructured, which results in demanding data interpretation and control algorithms. Similarly, the control and decision-making algorithms inevitably become more complex in order to be able to cope with the unstructured and dynamic environment. Consequently a sophisticated evaluation/test environment is required, which provides full control of the circumstances, reproducibility and flexible mix of real and virtual components. The paper presents the runtime architecture of a simulation environment (MARS), which assures scalable real-time performance and a modeling framework, which supports incorporating high fidelity sensor models.

Unfortunately, the practical application of such systems is not achieved without difficulties. Complications of a technical but so conceptual nature generally appear. The spatial and temporal data present fundamental problems with the DBMS, not only because of the considerable size and the constant growth of these data, but also because of the complexity of the geometrical and topological relations between these data. From this, the spatio-temporal modeling represents many difficulties. The main goal of our work is to solve this problem in the biological domain and particularly the spatio-temporal modeling and visualisation of molecular and functional network. In order to do that, we propose a system based on multiagent system with the virtual reality allowing the user to interact with the three-dimensional image objects. As a computer-generated representation of a three-dimensional environment, virtual reality enables the user to view and manipulate the contents of an environment. Virtual reality is often referred to as the technology that gives a user the experience of being immersed in a computer-generated virtual world. Although virtual reality is a very useful application for examining and understanding complex data sets. In this paper, we started by the state of the art of the existing systems for modeling the biological data and their interactions (molecular and functional), then we described the multiagent architecture of the spatio-temporal modeling of molecular and functional interactions based on virtual reality techniques","","0-7803-9521-2","10.1109/ICTTA.2006.1684902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1684902","","Biological system modeling;Virtual reality;Biology computing;Genetics;Computer networks;Computational modeling;Cells (biology);Computer simulation;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Bioinformatics","","1","","6","IEEE","16 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

UAV twins (UTs), as the digital twins of UAVs that revolutionize UAV applications by making them more immersive, realistic, and informative, are deployed and updated on ground base stations, e.g., roadside units (RSUs), to offer metaverse services for UAV metaverse users (UMUs). Due to the dynamic mobility of UAVs and limited communication coverages of RSUs, it is essential to perform real-time UT migration to ensure seamless immersive experiences for UMUs. However, selecting appropriate RSUs and optimizing the required bandwidth is challenging for achieving reliable and efficient UT migration. To address the challenges, we propose a tiny machine learning-based Stackelberg game framework based on pruning techniques for efficient UT migration in UAV metaverses. Specifically, we formulate a multileader multifollower Stackelberg model considering a new immersion metric of UMUs in the utilities of UAVs. Then, we design a Tiny multiagent deep reinforcement learning (Tiny MADRL) algorithm to obtain the tiny networks representing the optimal game solution.

With the properties of autonomy, social ability, reactivity and proactiveness, agents can be used to represent entities in DVE, where fast and accurate decision making is a determining factor of the whole environment. This paper provides a description of integrating agents into an HLA-based distributed simulation. It focuses on how to construct the sensor of an agent with different interest management schemes. Using the JADE (Java agent development framework) agent toolkit and the high level architecture (HLA) in our prototype, a minesweeping game, we outline two different implementations of this game. Due to the dynamic characteristics of agents, a problem of overdue information from the environment is discussed, and we propose an enlarged subscription region method to solve this problem. Moreover, advisories provided by the HLA are adopted to reduce the overheads.

This provides-with little additional effort-the ""new human"" with capabilities ranging from natural arm movement up to the coordinated operation of his arms and the cooperation between multiple anthropomorphic kinematics. The same general hierarchical control structure that has successfully been used to control multi-robot systems for space and industrial application has therefore been enhanced to incorporate the newly required capabilities. The enhancements focus on a new approach to on the one hand consider human extremities as articulated robots which are mechanically connected to make up the body-and on the other hand to provide a control strategy to move the full body correctly under equilibrium conditions. We provide an overall control structure that preserves the capabilities of the single robots and introduces ""sensible couplings"" to move the body as a whole in a naturally looking way. As described in the paper, this work is currently being applied to several application fields in industry up to the simulation of astronauts' work on the International Space Station.","","0-7803-7860-1","10.1109/IROS.2003.1249724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1249724","","Control systems;Anthropomorphism;Multiagent systems;Robot kinematics;Humans;Aerospace industry;Service robots;Robot sensing systems;Orbital robotics;Arm","","6","","11","IEEE","3 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Autonomous intelligent agents have a control on their own actions and states, supporting or taking effective decisions. Therefore, some qualitative parameters such as trust, reputation and quality of information have to be taken under consideration to evaluate, certify and justify such decisions. Indeed, this paper shows how to construct a dynamic virtual world of complex and interacting entities or agents, organized in terms of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), that compete against one another in order to solve a particular problem, according to a rigorous selection regime in which its fitness is judged by one criterion alone, a measure of the quality of information of the agent or agents, here understood as evolutionary logic theories. This virtual world could witness the emergence of our first learning, thinking machines, that may cater for some issues on the evolution of formal models of the world in general, and on what is concerned with the objectives set to this work, in contracting, and foray into a vast, untapped technological market.","","0-7695-2749-3","10.1109/WI-IATW.2006.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053311","","Law;Legal factors;Software agents;Contracts;Humans;Intelligent agent;Multiagent systems;Particle measurements;Logic;Machine learning","","2","","5","IEEE","8 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is based on assumption that multi-agent system constitutes social network and so it is an instantiation of the complex network. Several metrics used in description of this type of networks can be used to model trust relation between agents. In the presented model the agent¿s A trust in an agent¿s B statements is obtained as the subjective logic consensus of modified trust levels of all agents that trust the agent B. The trust level modification is performed in relation to the current position of the agent in the network.","","978-1-4244-2196-1","10.1109/ISKE.2008.4731155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731155","","Social network services;Multiagent systems;Complex networks;Intelligent systems;Knowledge engineering;Logic;Feedback;Intelligent networks;Paper technology;IP networks","","3","","15","IEEE","30 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, varies types of smart vehicles with distinct capacities, diverse applications with different resource demands as well as unpredictive vehicular topology, pose significant challenges on realizing efficient edge computing services. To cope with these challenges, we incorporate digital twin technology and artificial intelligence into the design of a vehicular edge computing network. It centrally exploits potential edge service matching through evaluating cooperation gains in a mirrored edge computing system, while distributively scheduling computation task offloading and edge resource allocation in an multiagent deep reinforcement learning approach. We further propose a coordination graph driven vehicular task offloading scheme, which minimizes offloading costs through efficiently integrating service matching exploitation and intelligent offloading scheduling in both digital twin and physical networks. Numerical results based on real urban traffic datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed schemes.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3088407","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071092,61941102); Key R&D Project of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2019YFG0520); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0117500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9451579","Digital twin;multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG);vehicular edge computing","Task analysis;Digital twin;Edge computing;Artificial intelligence;Servers;Reinforcement learning;Processor scheduling","","221","","30","IEEE","10 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, how to optimally allocate limited communication and computation resources at the edge to a large number of users in the metaverse is quite challenging. In this article, we propose an adaptive edge resource allocation method based on multiagent soft actor–critic with graph convolutional networks (SAC-GCN). Specifically, SAC-GCN models the multiuser metaverse environment as a graph where each agent is denoted by a node. Each agent learns the interplay between agents by graph convolutional networks with a self-attention mechanism to further determine the resource usage for one user in the metaverse. The effectiveness of SAC-GCN is demonstrated through the analysis of user experience, balance of resource allocation, and resource utilization rate by taking a virtual city park metaverse as an example. Experimental results indicate that SAC-GCN outperforms other resource allocation methods in improving overall user experience, balancing resource allocation, and increasing resource utilization rate by at least 27%, 11%, and 8%, respectively.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3283335","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202107970008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10144631","Attention mechanism;extended reality (XR);graph convolutional network;multiagent reinforcement learning","Metaverse;Resource management;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Servers;Rendering (computer graphics);Headphones","","15","","40","IEEE","6 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to stay relevant to the demands and expectations of users in a Virtual Environment, agents must be able to adapt quickly and learn from other agents in order to perform well. The novelty of this paper lies in leveraging the potential of a new perspective of memetic computing and cultural transmission in a multi-agent environment through cultural evolution. This paper shares the concept from the perspective of not only vertically but also horizontal transmission of knowledge through memes selection, variation and transmission which calls for empirically verifying whether such a paradigm is viable for improving agents' learning capabilities in a multiagent environment. This research seeks to use the notion of memes in order to equip virtual agents with the essential learning capabilities that are closer to humanity.","2154-4824","978-1-889335-42-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5665582","Multi-Agent;Memetic;Culture Evolution","Neurons","","","","19","","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
