This paper proposes a decentralized framework based on an efficient federated deep reinforcement learning method for plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) fleet charging management in a residential community, which is equipped with a photovoltaic and battery energy storage system and connected to a local transformer. Firstly, the framework of PEV charging management is described as a virtual EV charging station coordinating charging tasks through sharing public information with distributed agents. Then, an individual preference model of PEV is developed considering heterogenous PEV charging anxiety, battery degradation, and collective penalty. Subsequently, we propose an attention-weighted federated soft-actor-critic method to efficiently seek the co-ordinational scheduling of the PEV fleet charging in a distributed way, where scalability and privacy protection can be ensured with attention-based information sharing. Finally, a real-world case study is conducted to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3206020","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1966205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9889708","Plug-in electric vehicles;residential community;coordination strategy;federated deep reinforcement learning","Reinforcement learning;State of charge;Electric vehicle charging;Batteries;Transformers;Plug-in electric vehicles;Anxiety disorders;Deep learning;Collaborative work","","26","","45","CCBY","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Agents that interact with a dynamic physical environment have requirements not shared by virtual agents, including the need to transfer information about the world and their interaction with it. The agent communication languages proven successful in software based multi-agent systems incur overheads that make them impractical or infeasible for the transfer of low-level data. Instead, real world systems typically employ application specific protocols to transfer video, audio, sensory, or telemetry data. These protocols lack the transparency and portability of formal agent communication languages and consequently are limited in their scalability. We propose augmenting the capabilities of current multi-agent systems to provide for the efficient transfer of low-level information, by allowing backchannels of communication between agents with flexible protocols in a carefully principled way. We show that this extension can yield significant performance increases in communication efficiency and discuss the benefits of incorporating backchannels into a search a rescue robot system.","1050-4729","0-7803-8232-3","10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1307377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1307377","","Multiagent systems;Robot kinematics;Telemetry;Streaming media;Software agents;Robot sensing systems;Frequency;Software systems;Decision making;Financial management","","35","","16","IEEE","6 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A virtual pheromone mechanism is proposed as the message passing coordination scheme among the robots. This hybrid ACO/PSO architecture adopts the feedback mechanism from environment of ACO and the adaptive interplay among agents of PSO to create a dynamic optimization system, and it is well-suited for a large scale distributed multi-agent system under dynamic environments. Furthermore, a pheromone-edge pair propagation funneling method is developed to reduce the communication overhead among robots.

The agents should reach an agreement on a time-varying reference trajectory as their virtual leader. The approach combines the artificial potential functions method with robust control terms to reach an appropriate controller for each agent. The unknown dynamics of each agent is approximated by an adaptive fuzzy system, with adaptive laws derived from Lyapunov stability analysis. Theoretical analysis reveals that Hœ performance criterion is satisfied and the effects of uncertainties are kept below a desired attenuation level. The proposed method is applied to the state tracking problem of five inverted pendulums. Results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling noise and bounded uncertainties as well as reaching consensus with high precision.","","978-1-5090-4917-2","10.1109/IFSA-SCIS.2017.8023325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8023325","adaptive fuzzy control;cooperative tracking control;artificial potential function;multi-agent systems","Fuzzy systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Multi-agent systems;Vehicle dynamics;Trajectory;Robustness","","6","","38","IEEE","31 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, this integration presents critical challenges, such as low Quality of Experience (QoE) due to the dynamic nature of aerial platforms, high resource demands, and the requirements for real-time data processing in the Metaverse environment. To address these challenges, we propose a Combinatorial Client-Master Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (CCM-MADRL) based joint resource allocation and QoE maximization framework to enable intelligent real-time decision-making in aerial MEC enabled Metaverse services. We form a collaborative ecosystem where agents are designed to represent both Metaverse service providers and aerial platforms to promote fairness and efficiency in resource allocation, as well as optimize service delivery. By incorporating CCM, our approach considers diverse metrics, such as latency, reliability, meta-distance, and energy efficiency, to ensure a holistic optimization of Metaverse services. The MADRL approach enables adaptive decision-making, allowing the system to respond to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of Metaverse applications. Results from simulations that mimic realistic Metaverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CCM-MADRL framework in terms of improved service performance, reduced latency, cost, and virtual meta-distance, maximized average QoE utility of Metaverse users, and enhanced resource utilization compared to baseline algorithms.","2576-6813","979-8-3503-5125-5","10.1109/GLOBECOM52923.2024.10901198","Qatar National Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10901198","CCM-MADRL;meta-distance;Metaverse;Quality of experience;Resource allocation","Measurement;Costs;Metaverse;Decision making;Stochastic processes;Real-time systems;Quality of experience;Resource management;Reliability;Optimization","","","","14","IEEE","11 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This unprecedented metaverse-infused driving experience, however, requires high-throughput transmissions for real-time high-quality 360° video streaming, which challenges today’s limited bandwidth resources provisioned by wireless communication infrastructure. To this end, this article introduces virtual road, real connection (VRRC), a novel framework for enhancing the metaverse-infused driving experience in VANET through the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). In the face of limited bandwidth resources, VRRC effectively addresses the challenge of high-throughput demand from two key perspectives. First, VRRC reduces redundant transmission by implementing a graph neural network (GNN)-based vehicle clustering method for dynamic multicast group formation, taking into account both the geographical status of vehicles and their communication patterns. Second, VRRC aggregates bandwidth resources across various channels by employing a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)–based multipath packet scheduling policy to adapt to heterogeneous channel conditions and dynamic vehicular mobility. Extensive experiments with real-world vehicular traces validate the effectiveness of VRRC and demonstrate its outperformance in reducing redundant traffic by 54% and improving overall throughput by 28%. VRRC represents a substantial leap forward in the integration of the metaverse experience into VANET.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2024.3422394","Major Key Project of Pengcheng Laboratory(grant numbers:PCL2023A06); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3105000); Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Software Defined Networking Grant(grant numbers:ZDSYS20140509172959989); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10596059","Graph neural networks (GNNs);metaverse;multipath TCP (MPTCP);reinforcement learning;vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Vehicle dynamics;Scheduling algorithms;Metaverse;Bandwidth;Streaming media;Internet of Things","","","","30","IEEE","11 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
