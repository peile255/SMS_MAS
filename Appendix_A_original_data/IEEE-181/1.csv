One such move is the incorporation of 3D virtual worlds in the learning environment. Another is the increasing development of multiagent systems that support the learner or the tutor. Integrating pedagogically based multiagent systems with 3D virtual worlds could provide a more engaging immersive learning environment. This paper explores the feasibility of integrating a 3D virtual world with a pedagogical multiagent system named QuizMASter, an educational game for elearning that helps students learn their course material through friendly competition. The integration was developed by devising, implementing and testing an approach using open source technologies, namely, Open Wonderland and JADE. The result is encouraging as the integration is technically feasible, not overly difficult and opens a door to further integration opportunities.","","978-1-61284-829-7","10.1109/WAINA.2011.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763564","Education;Multi User Virtual Environment;3D Virtual Worlds;Multiagent Systems","Three dimensional displays;Multiagent systems;Games;Computer architecture;Java;Artificial intelligence;Collaboration","","13","","22","IEEE","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intelligent software agents are able to provide a more attractive narrative and get the users more involved in the unfolding of the story line in the virtual world. However, designing and implementing a software agent or a multi-agent system (MAS) for this purpose requires the developer to be highly skilled in agent oriented software engineering (AOSE) and a large investment in time and effort. This raises the hurdle to develop non-trivial agent augmented interactive e-learning applications. Our research proposes a framework - the multi-agent development environment (MADE) - to resolve this problem by abstracting the agent implementation part into a reusable runtime environment so as to enable less technically inclined people (e.g. teachers) and developers with limited knowledge in AOSE to rapidly prototype a multi-agent system to be incorporated into interactive learning applications.","2161-377X","978-0-7695-3167-0","10.1109/ICALT.2008.65","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561872","Multi-agent Systems;Agent-augmented Virtual Environment;Agent-mediated Immersive Learning","Multiagent systems;Application software;Intelligent agent;Software agents;Electronic learning;Software engineering;Investments;Runtime environment;Avatars;Humans","","4","","15","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This NEXUS becomes a place in which virtual and physical information spaces become entwined, resulting in the entities that inhabit this space being able to interact in a seamless fashion. The level of interaction envisaged is not simply a matter of people controlling the form of a virtual space, or even one of artificial entities that control the form of a physical space.

With this idea in mind, we've taken the movie metaphor to implement a prototype simulation system where the user steps into Truman's shoes. The set of our ""movie"" is a driving simulator, and the user is learning to drive a car. During the driving lessons, users drive in a virtual world that lets them experience all kinds of traffic scenarios. The system generates the scenarios with the student as the focal point, and the other traffic entities respond to the student's behavior, without the student noticing. To control the traffic scenarios and make them more effective, our prototype employs an agent-based framework. In this framework, each entity in the simulator is an actor agent playing a role. The prototype also includes a hierarchy of directors that directs the main action and the behind-the-scenes activity. The advantage of the movie metaphor is that it helps separate scenario description from scenario playing. The agents can read their required information from a script and perform their actions based on that information.

Although the behavior of an agent is usually included in its structure, we dissociate here the concept of agent from that of interaction, each one being associated with a specific ontology. This approach is especially valuable for increasing the reutilisability of the interactions, which are very often generic even in contexts where the agents are not. In a first part, we describe and compare our approach to the classic one. Then a list of properties is given to show the benefit to consider an interaction, not only as a communication means, but also as an entity shared by all agents and not reserved to some of them. An illustration of our approach is given in a road traffic application using VRML.","2157-4960","978-1-42443547-0","10.1109/NTMS.2008.ECP.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689106","","Multiagent systems;World Wide Web;Ontologies;Roads;Context;Virtual reality;Resource management;Application software;Traffic control;Web sites","","","","12","","25 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combined with emergent paradigms for manufacturing control, such as multi-agent systems and service-orientation principles, and using a formal language to describe the system behavior, e.g. Petri nets, a truly and complete virtual production environment is achieved. This paper discusses this powerful approach to the virtual design and production environment driven by formal models, allowing users to design and deploy collaborative and reconfigurable automation applications in a faster and cost-effective fashion. A special attention is devoted to the process of migration from the virtual environment to the real world, aiming to reduce the transition time and increasing the efficiency of the process.","2378-363X","978-1-4244-3759-7","10.1109/INDIN.2009.5195861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5195861","","Production;Virtual manufacturing;Computer aided manufacturing;Product design;Manufacturing systems;Time to market;Costs;Control systems;Multiagent systems;Formal languages","","3","","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the railway field, that we chose as a field of application to illustrate our proposals in this article, simulation makes sense because of the complexity involved and the risk for personnel during upstream phases of validation. To be able to simulation with enough precision, the model of the virtual universe is a key point. Especially For train component simulation, an accurate and detailed model of the train component is mandatory. For training the drivers within a serious game, a high visual quality is required. Obtaining a single model supporting these two constraints at the same time at the lowest cost is still an open issue and involved many actors. Our contribution is a methodology and a process for creating a virtual universe model, based on automatic model generation, in order to allow the creation of large-scale universes while guaranteeing a level of details appropriate to the need, a model of constant quality and including semantic data necessary for simulation, while reducing the modeling costs and the modeling duration. The proposed process is applied to train simulation.","1941-1197","","10.1109/MITS.2019.2939110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839039","","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Data models;Mathematical model;Urban areas;Rail transportation","","2","","62","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Behavioural realism of modelling multi-agent communication protocols in virtual environment","G.

This because virtual environments provide 3d simulation tools that allow for more realistic simulations. Embedding human capability into the control system software, the work considers the application of a multiple robots communication system. Current implementations of full-scale virtual environments to evaluate robotic applications is used for the purpose of simulating and testing the hardware whilst producing single-robot applications. The work presented in this paper exemplifies the use of full-scale virtual environments to test the communication between multiple robots. This implementation of virtual environments is shown to be efficient as it allows users to: a) greater understand the robots' behaviours under different communication rules, b) easier compare different communication techniques, centralised/decentralised and hybrid communications. Employing the virtual environment as a testing tool increases the efficiency of the evaluation process. The visual assessment outputs using a semiimmersive full-scale environment also has been advantageous in directing numerical analysis.","","978-1-4244-3396-4","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2008.4781701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781701","","Protocols;Virtual environment;Robots;Application software;System testing;Multiagent systems;Humans;Communication system control;Control systems;System software","","","","12","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First and Third International Symposium on Agent Systems Applications, and Mobile Agents","6 Aug 2002","1999","","","234","241","Describes a guide system and the software architecture for an autonomous, interactive robot based on a multi-agent system. A robot navigation system has been developed allowing the robot to guide people through halls in various types of exhibitions. Our approach uses an infrared location system in the hallway ceilings, making the environment part of a sensor-distributed robot system. The real-world guide agent is composed of a guide agent on a hand-held mobile computer and a robot agent on an autonomous mobile robot. The guide agent plays the role of ""robot media"" in order to integrate information in the information space of the mobile computer and the physical space of the exhibits in order to guide visitors through the physical space. This research aims to develop a cooperative adaptive system using two-way communication among spaces, media and human beings to construct transparent knowledge boundaries between the real space and the virtual space. The virtual space is generated from computer data using shared space technology and it creates a distributed intelligence in order to manage the communication and control the guide in a laboratory. We have experimented with and verified this software architecture using a prototype autonomous mobile robot equipped with a compass.","","0-7695-0340-3","10.1109/ASAMA.1999.805407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=805407","","Robot sensing systems;Space technology;Mobile robots;Software architecture;Orbital robotics;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Multiagent systems;Navigation;Infrared sensors","","3","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
