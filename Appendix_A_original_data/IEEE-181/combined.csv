An Approach for Integrating 3D Virtual Worlds with Multiagent Systems,J. Blair; F. Lin,"School of Computing and Information Systems, Athabasca University, Banff, AB, Canada; School of Computing and Information Systems, Athabasca University, Athabasca, Canada",2011 IEEE Workshops of International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications,5 May 2011,2011,,,580,585,"Education is incorporating more and more of the capabilities provided by the Internet. One such move is the incorporation of 3D virtual worlds in the learning environment. Another is the increasing development of multiagent systems that support the learner or the tutor. Integrating pedagogically based multiagent systems with 3D virtual worlds could provide a more engaging immersive learning environment. This paper explores the feasibility of integrating a 3D virtual world with a pedagogical multiagent system named QuizMASter, an educational game for elearning that helps students learn their course material through friendly competition. The integration was developed by devising, implementing and testing an approach using open source technologies, namely, Open Wonderland and JADE. The result is encouraging as the integration is technically feasible, not overly difficult and opens a door to further integration opportunities.",,978-1-61284-829-7,10.1109/WAINA.2011.15,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763564,Education;Multi User Virtual Environment;3D Virtual Worlds;Multiagent Systems,Three dimensional displays;Multiagent systems;Games;Computer architecture;Java;Artificial intelligence;Collaboration,,13.0,,22.0,IEEE,5 May 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Intelligent software agents are able to provide a more attractive narrative and get the users more involved in the unfolding of the story line in the virtual world.

Your world is that of Truman Burbank, from the 1998 movie The Truman Show. With this idea in mind, we've taken the movie metaphor to implement a prototype simulation system where the user steps into Truman's shoes. The set of our ""movie"" is a driving simulator, and the user is learning to drive a car. During the driving lessons, users drive in a virtual world that lets them experience all kinds of traffic scenarios. The system generates the scenarios with the student as the focal point, and the other traffic entities respond to the student's behavior, without the student noticing. To control the traffic scenarios and make them more effective, our prototype employs an agent-based framework. In this framework, each entity in the simulator is an actor agent playing a role. The prototype also includes a hierarchy of directors that directs the main action and the behind-the-scenes activity. The advantage of the movie metaphor is that it helps separate scenario description from scenario playing. The agents can read their required information from a script and perform their actions based on that information.

Although the behavior of an agent is usually included in its structure, we dissociate here the concept of agent from that of interaction, each one being associated with a specific ontology. This approach is especially valuable for increasing the reutilisability of the interactions, which are very often generic even in contexts where the agents are not.

The modeling formalism of James imposes only few constraints on the modeling of agents and facilitates a ""plug and test"" with pieces of agent code which has been demonstrated in earlier work. However, even entire agents can be run in James as they are run in their run-time environment. The integration of agents as a whole is based on model templates which serve as the agents' interface and representative during the simulation run. The effort which is put into defining model templates for selected agent systems obviates the need for the single agent programmer to get acquainted with the underlying modeling and simulation formalism. Instead, the agent programmer can compose the experimental frame and test the programmed agents as they are. The approach is illustrated with agents of the mobile agent system, Mole.",,0-7803-6579-8,10.1109/WSC.2000.899162,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899162,,Plugs;Software testing;Software agents;System testing;Computational modeling;Multiagent systems;Discrete event simulation;Computer science;Programming profession;Virtual environment,,8.0,,19.0,,6 Aug 2002,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
A Normative Agent System to Prevent Cyberbullying,T. Bosse; S. Stam,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology,10 Oct 2011,2011,2,,425,430,"Automated approaches to prevent the negative effects of cyber bullying mainly focus on affective agents that provide support for victims. The current paper takes a complementary approach, which attempts to minimise the amount of occurrences of cyber bullying in the first place. The approach consists of a system of normative agents, which are physically present in a virtual society. The agents, which reason based on a BDI-model, use a number of techniques to detect various norm violations, including insulting and following. By using rewards and punishments, they try to reinforce the desired behaviour of the users. The system has been implemented and tested within a virtual environment for children between 6 and 12 years old, called Club Time Machine. In a real world experiment, the behaviour of the users of the virtual environment has been logged and analysed by means of a logic-based checking tool. The results show that the normative agents have the potential to reduce the amount of norm violations on the long term.",,978-1-4577-1373-6,10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.24,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6040669,cyberbullying;normative agents;BDI,Virtual environments;XML;Pattern matching;Monitoring;Engines;Multiagent systems;Servers,,19.0,1.0,18.0,IEEE,10 Oct 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To address these issues, we propose adaptive social metaverse streaming (ASMS), a novel streaming system based on federated multiagent proximal policy optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT.

UAV twins (UTs), as the digital twins of UAVs that revolutionize UAV applications by making them more immersive, realistic, and informative, are deployed and updated on ground base stations, e.g., roadside units (RSUs), to offer metaverse services for UAV metaverse users (UMUs). Due to the dynamic mobility of UAVs and limited communication coverages of RSUs, it is essential to perform real-time UT migration to ensure seamless immersive experiences for UMUs. However, selecting appropriate RSUs and optimizing the required bandwidth is challenging for achieving reliable and efficient UT migration. To address the challenges, we propose a tiny machine learning-based Stackelberg game framework based on pruning techniques for efficient UT migration in UAV metaverses.

This approach foresees the use of a distributed architecture, adhering to the RAMI 4.0 architecture.

Intrusion detection algorithm in Smart Environments featuring activity footprints approach,A. Forestiero,"Institute for High Performance Computing and Networking CNR - ICAR, Rende, Italy",2020 IEEE Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (AIKE),19 Feb 2021,2020,,,134,137,"Discovering anomalous data or behaviors is fundamental to obtain critical security information such as intrusion detections, faults and system failures. The limited resources, like computing and storage, make conventional techniques to design Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) not particularly suitable for smart environments. This paper proposes a novel multiagent algorithm leveraging on devices activity footprints for intrusion detection in Internet of Things environment. Smart objects are mapped with real-valued vectors obtained through the IoT2Vec model, a word embedding technique able to capture the semantic context of device activities and represent these ones in dense vectors. The vectors are assigned to agents, which are spread onto a 2D virtual space, where they move following the rules of a bio-inspired model, the flocking model. A similarity function, applied to the associated vectors, drives the agents for a selective application of the movement rules. The outcome is the emergence of agent groups aggregated on the basis of the activities of their associated devices. Thus, it is possible to easily individuate isolated agents (i.e. devices with dissimilar activity from all), representing potential intruders or with anomalous behaviors to be monitored. Preliminary results confirm the validity of the approach.",,978-1-7281-8708-2,10.1109/AIKE48582.2020.00027,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355441,Intrusion detection;Activity footprints;Multiagent systems;Smart Environments,Biological system modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Two dimensional displays;Semantics;Intrusion detection;Security;Smart devices,,4.0,,13.0,IEEE,19 Feb 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

As a result, Masbiole can escape from Nash Equilibria and obtain better performances than conventional MAS where agents consider only their own benefits. This paper focuses on the evolutionary model of Masbiole, and its characteristics are examined especially with an emphasis on the behaviors of agents obtained by symbiotic evolution. In the simulations, two ideas suitable for the effective analysis of such behaviors are introduced; ""Match Type Tile-world (MTT)"" and ""Genetic Network Programming (GNP)"".

Unfortunately, these systems can only react upon the presence of traffic jams and not to prevent the creation of unnecessary congestion. Anticipatory vehicle routing is promising in that respect, because this approach allows directing vehicle routing by accounting for traffic forecast information. This paper presents a decentralized approach for anticipatory vehicle routing that is particularly useful in large-scale dynamic environments. The approach is based on delegate multiagent systems, i.e., an environment-centric coordination mechanism that is, in part, inspired by ant behavior. Antlike agents explore the environment on behalf of vehicles and detect a congestion forecast, allowing vehicles to reroute. The approach is explained in depth and is evaluated by comparison with three alternative routing strategies. The experiments are done in simulation of a real-world traffic environment. The experiments indicate a considerable performance gain compared with the most advanced strategy under test, i.e., a traffic-message-channel-based routing strategy.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2011.2105867,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730496,Autonomous agents;distributed control;intelligent vehicles;mobile agents;multiagent systems;navigation;software architecture;traffic control,Vehicles;Roads;Routing;Urban areas;Virtual environment;Driver circuits,,170.0,,29.0,IEEE,14 Mar 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In this paper we propose a data stream clustering method based on a multi-agent system that uses a decentralized bottom-up self-organizing strategy to group similar data points. Data points are associated with agents and deployed onto a 2D space, to work simultaneously by applying a heuristic strategy based on a bio-inspired model, known as flocking model. Agents move onto the space for a fixed time and, when they encounter other agents into a predefined visibility range, they can decide to form a flock if they are similar.

Semantic shared space-based complex tasks allocation method for massive MAS,Z. Brahmi; M. M. Gammoudi,"URSIIVA Research Unit, Tunisia; High School of Statistics and Information Analysis of Tunis, Tunisia",2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology,11 Sep 2009,2009,,,428,434,"Task allocation is still a fundamental problem in multi-agents system (MAS). It allows coalition formation of agents in order to cooperate together to perform a complex task. In general, the task allocation process includes two steps: i) finding the set of agents that can, potentially, participate to task allocation process, ii) computing the optimal allocation to execute the given task. In this work further attention is given for the first step. Indeed, in the context of massive MAS, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous and a large number of autonomous agents, an efficient model of communication is required. This implies a need for a scalable and semantic infrastructure which allows: i) agents to be able to easily find each other and ii) semantic interoperability that refers to a common understanding of information communicated between agents. In this work information refers to an announced task. Different models of communication have been proposed, including broadcasting, forwarding, central server and group communication. Most of these approaches do not scale well in the context of massive MAS; when the number of agents grows. In additional, agent communication languages (ACLs), such as the KQML or FIPA ACL divide messages into several layers, and provide a specific syntax and semantics only for the outer layer, but its content is still arbitrary. To deal with these limitations, this paper extends our last task allocation method for massive MAS to shared space mechanism. This mechanism allows agents to find each by providing a logical shared space with temporal and special decoupling properties. To ensure semantic interoperability, we use a Task Ontology language (OWL-T) as a tuple space and a FIPA content message. OWL-T is based on the OWL for formally and semantically defining task in a high-level abstraction.",,978-1-4244-4519-6,10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234814,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234814,Task Allocation;Massive Multi-Agents System;Communication;Shared space;Ontology;OWL-T,Multiagent systems;Autonomous agents;Ontologies;Web services;Statistical analysis;Information analysis;Context modeling;Broadcasting;Mechanical factors;OWL,,4.0,,37.0,IEEE,11 Sep 2009,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Vectorial-Opinion Dynamics With Familiarity Neighborhoods in Virtual Social Groups,N. Vedam; D. Ghose,"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India; Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India",IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,1 Aug 2022,2022,9.0,4.0,1249,1264,"In this work, we mimic interactions among agents on social networks and examine their impact on the evolution of agents’ opinions. Each agent is entitled to an opinion represented by unit vectors of varying orientation. Agents are also characterized based on their inclination to alter their opinion and their susceptibility to the influence of peers with contrasting opinions. The agents constitute the nodes of a directed and time-varying influence network whose edges form their respective familiarity neighborhoods and govern their interactions. We also devise an interpersonal influence score to quantify the strength of the influence and the probability of acquisition, retention, or loss of a tie. This characterization of agents’ behavior and their interpersonal relationships differs from traditional bounded-confidence models based on the agreement in opinions alone. The agents with different traits form groups—liberal and conservative—distinguished by the distribution in opinions of their constituents. We analyze their interactions with different initial opinions, group compositions, network structures, and network evolution rates through simulations. The results reveal that flexible agents facilitate consensus among group members, while stubborn agents are instrumental in forming opinion clusters. This is substantiated by observing the average connectedness of the influence network and the average number of opinion clusters; groups with mostly flexible agents have better connectedness and fewer clusters than groups with stubborn agents in a majority. The simulations with stubborn agents reveal that new ties among agent pairs do not facilitate group consensus.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2021.3122137,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597470,Influence dynamics;multiagent systems;opinion consensus;opinion neighborhood;social networks,Social networking (online);Resource management;Peer-to-peer computing;Instruments;Decision making;Social groups;Size measurement,,4.0,,57.0,IEEE,1 Nov 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas-simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.",1943-0698,,10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2560882,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463035,Complexity;fidelity;level of detail artificial intelligence (LOD AI);multiagent systems;multiobjective optimization,Complexity theory;Multi-agent systems;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Learning systems;Games,,12.0,,36.0,IEEE,29 Apr 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

As highly computerized avatars of vehicular metaverse users (VMUs), the vehicle twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy.

To specialize actors, the framework uses effect and cost modifiers, which modify existing action definitions, and constraints, which prune action choices in a state-dependent manner.

However, deploying a single large drone might not be efficient for completing tasks compared to the use of a heterogeneous swarm of smaller and lighter drones, which can better adapt to different application scenarios and reduce the mission time. In this sense, Search and Rescue (SAR) activities represent an important field of application. Heterogeneous multiagent systems require ad-hoc Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) algorithms to effectively manage the agents of the swarm.

Tailor-made mechanisms are engaging in the light of disputes to resolve emerging contradictions between the atoms. Most of the dominant blockchain architectures tend to oversee this fact. They come integrated with rigid, overkilling consensus-achievement procedures, which, in many cases, are not necessary or significantly beneficial. They often raise overwhelming demands on the nodes and prohibit the deployment of fully distributed and peer blockchain operation in the IoT world. Still, for the IoT ecosystems and the metaverse to become self-sustainable and self-evolving, robust validity mechanisms must be embedded in the atomic scale.

To study the dynamic behavior of the system, a competitive game among the nodes is run. The Proof of Existence (PoE) is utilized as a universal proofing case.

Such uncontrolled dispersion of vehicles can be avoided by evenly distributing vehicles along alternative routes. This paper proposes a practical multiagent-based approach, which is designed to achieve acceptable route allocation within a short time frame and with low communication overheads. In the proposed approach, which is called Congestion Avoidance and Route Allocation using Virtual Agent Negotiation (CARAVAN), vehicle agents (VAs) in the local vicinity communicate with each other before designated decision points (junctions) along their route. Cooperative route-allocation decisions are performed at these junctions. VAs use intervehicular communication to propagate key traffic information and undertake its distributed processing. Every VA exchanges its autonomously calculated route preference information to arrive at an initial allocation of routes. The allocation is improved using a number of successive virtual negotiation “deals.” The virtual nature of these deals requires no physical communication and, thereby, reduces communication requirements. In addition to the theory and concept, this paper presents the design and implementation methodology of CARAVAN, including experimental results for synthetic and real-world road networks. Results show that when compared against the shortest path algorithm for travel time improvements, CARAVAN offers 21%-43% gain (when traffic demand is below network capacity) and 13%-17% gain (when traffic demand exceeds network capacity), demonstrating its ability to regulate overall system traffic using local coordination strategies.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2013.2256420,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6507596,Cooperative systems;dynamic traffic assignment;multiagent systems (MAS);traffic congestion management,Vehicles;Resource management;Roads;Indexes;Vehicle dynamics;Real-time systems;Software,,47.0,,26.0,IEEE,24 Apr 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

MDSM: Generalized multiagent coordination for demand side management,A. Veit,"Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York",2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm),21 Mar 2016,2015,,,73.0,78.0,"One key challenge in creating a sustainable society is to make consumer demand adaptive to the supply of electricity. We propose a generalization for the multiagent coordination algorithm for partially-centralized demand side management. In this setting, a central unit buys the electricity for the whole group, while the individual agents make their own demand decisions, based on their private constraints and preferences. While the state-of-the-art algorithm achieves strong guarantees, i.e., efficiency, strict budget balance as well as weak incentive compatibility, the formulation requires a simple supply model with a 2-step increasing threshold price function. In this paper, we propose MDSM, a generalized formulation of the multiagent coordination algorithm and prove that it converges to the optimal solution for all convex piecewise linear cost functions. Further, we perform simulations based on real world consumption data to evaluate the scalability of the algorithm in respect to the number of thresholds. The results indicate that the convergence time of MDSM is not sensitive to the number of thresholds in the cost function. This means, the proposed algorithm could be used for a broader set of distributed scheduling problems.",,978-1-4673-8289-2,10.1109/SmartGridComm.2015.7436279,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436279,,Smart grids;Cost function;Convergence;Load management;Companies;Optimal scheduling;Conferences,,2.0,,14.0,IEEE,21 Mar 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In order to make them work without human involved and interaction, there is necessity of enabling them with intelligent, smart, or autonomic computing capabilities. Of course, intelligent function embedded is a straightforward approach. However, it may be difficult for the tiny devices to embed the intelligent computing capabilities due to their limited capacity and processing power. For a multiple intelligent agents system, it is not efficient to develop and maintain intelligent computing functions for each individual agent. Therefore, the idea is to design an intelligence entity sharing pool in which a requested intelligence entity can be dynamically composed from a number of atomic intelligence entities and complex intelligence entities residing in the intelligence entity pool and posted to virtual objects (v-object) in the v-object server for sharing by ubiquitous devices in the real world.

The simulations confirmed many of the hypotheses. However the benefits of a small world size are dependent on memory size, and the usefulness of rapidly evolving estimates of cooperation is dependent on the types of strategies employed by the agents.

Furthermore, dynamic environments pose additional challenges for motion planning due to a continual requirement for validation and refinement of plans. This work addresses the issues with vector-field-based motion generation strategies, which are often prone to local-minima problems. We aim to bridge the gap between reactive solutions, global planning, and constrained cooperative (two-arm) manipulation in partially known surroundings. To this end, we introduce novel planning and real-time control strategies leveraging the geometry of the task space that are inherently coupled for seamless operation in dynamic scenarios. Our integrated multiagent global planning and control scheme explores controllable sets in the previously introduced cooperative dual task space and flexibly controls them by exploiting the redundancy of the high degree-of-freedom (DOF) system. The planning and control framework is extensively validated in complex, cluttered, and nonstationary simulation scenarios where our framework is able to complete constrained tasks in a reliable manner, whereas existing solutions fail. We also perform additional real-world experiments with a two-armed 14 DOF torque-controlled KoBo robot.

AI-Enabled Network-Functions Virtualization and Software-Defined Architectures for Customized Statistical QoS Over 6G Massive MIMO Mobile Wireless Networks,X. Zhang; Q. Zhu,"Texas A&M University, USA; Texas A&M University, USA",IEEE Network,5 Sep 2023,2023,37.0,2.0,30.0,37.0,"With the rapid deployments of the fifth generation (5G) mobile wireless networks, the shift from the 5G to the sixth generation (6G) mobile wireless networks has attracted tremendous research attention around the world. Featuring with the explosively increasing multimedia-traffics with very diverse services requirements, the 6G mobile wireless networks need to provide the customized services with heterogeneous types of quality of service (QoS) guarantees. However, how to efficiently support these customized services with heterogeneous QoS provisioning for 6G wireless networks has imposed many new challenges not encountered before. To conquer these difficulties, in this article we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled integration of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) techniques with network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined network (SDN) architectures to support the customized services over the 6G mobile wireless networks. Specifically, we develop the AI-enabled network architectural schemes which efficiently integrate three 6G-candidate techniques - massive-MIMO, NFV, and SDN - to significantly improve key performances of heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning in terms of effective capacity. We apply the massive MIMO transmission to substantially improve the channel throughput. Our NFV-based schemes abstract and slice the physical infrastructure and wireless resources in network data plane into several virtualized networks and obtain the optimal service delivery path with the maximum effective capacity among virtualized networks. Also, we develop a set of AI-enabled techniques including multiagent AI-plane architectures, edge-Al frameworks, and federated learning mechanisms for efficiently implementing our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated schemes. Collaborating with our developed platform and techniques, our multi-agent AI-plane based SDN controller coordinates the network nodes and resources allocations for each virtualized network. Our conducted extensive simulations validate and evaluate our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated architectures using AI-techniques, showing that they can efficiently support the customized statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning over 6G mobile wireless networks.",1558-156X,,10.1109/MNET.005.2200408,U.S. Air Force(grant numbers:FA9453-15-C-0423); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10239348,,6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Wireless networks;Quality of service;Massive MIMO;Throughput;Network function virtualization;Artificial intelligence;Software defined networking,,8.0,,15.0,IEEE,5 Sep 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Magazines

In tile-based 360° video streaming, edge caching and bitrate selection strategies are jointly designed to improve users’ Quality of Experience (QoE), which incorporates video quality and rebuffer. However, the existing QoE-driven approaches use a unified QoE function to guide the decisions of edge caching and bitrate selection, which neglect the impact of video quality and rebuffer on different categories of 360° videos, thus failing to provide high-average QoE for users. In this article, we propose a multiagent deep-reinforcement-learning-based joint edge caching and bitrate selection strategy for multicategory 360° video streaming to improve users’ average QoE. The key idea is to employ different edge caching and bitrate selection strategies for different video categories to enable fine-grained performance optimization. Based on multicategory 360° video streaming, we first model a joint edge caching and bitrate selection problem as a multiagent cooperative Markov decision process with the goal of maximizing users’ average QoE. Next, an Field-of-View-aware multiagent soft actor–critic (FA-MASAC) algorithm is designed to help agents collaboratively learn optimal edge caching and bitrate selection decisions in a distributed way, in which each video category is treated as an agent. Finally, experimental results on real-world data sets show that our proposed strategy can greatly benefit users’ average QoE compared to existing strategies.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2023.3287187,National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072330); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(grant numbers:20211093); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155309,Bitrate selection;edge caching;multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL);multicategory 360° video streaming;Quality of Experience (QoE),Streaming media;Bit rate;Quality of experience;Video recording;Quality assessment;Game theory;Bandwidth,,11.0,,42.0,IEEE,19 Jun 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Given such predictions, we define a Nonlinear Probabilistic Velocity Obstacle (NPVO), which can be used select a velocity that is collision free with a given probability. We take a step towards formal verification of our approach, using statistical model checking to approximate the probability that our system will mispredict an obstacle's motion.

Agents that interact with a dynamic physical environment have requirements not shared by virtual agents, including the need to transfer information about the world and their interaction with it. The agent communication languages proven successful in software based multi-agent systems incur overheads that make them impractical or infeasible for the transfer of low-level data. Instead, real world systems typically employ application specific protocols to transfer video, audio, sensory, or telemetry data. These protocols lack the transparency and portability of formal agent communication languages and consequently are limited in their scalability. We propose augmenting the capabilities of current multi-agent systems to provide for the efficient transfer of low-level information, by allowing backchannels of communication between agents with flexible protocols in a carefully principled way.
