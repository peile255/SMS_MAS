In the same way, the ability to respond rapidly to changing market opportunities by quickly providing the required combination of design and manufacturing capabilities becomes a key issue to maintain competitively. In this context, the concept of virtual enterprise takes an increasing importance in supporting future business engagements and fulfilling technology requirements. As short-term consortia of companies to address fast changing opportunities, the virtual enterprise may be modeled by a multi-agent system representation. Such an approach allows modeling the heterogeneous actors of the real world in terms of agents, focusing on communication and collaboration between them. The feasibility of the multi-agent approach has already been demonstrated in the manufacturing and financial fields. This paper shows how a multi agent approach may be used in the modeling of virtual enterprises. An example of an agent, the ""controller agent"", will be described in details. The multi-agent system used, called PVS98, has been developed in the framework of an Eureka project. It relies on a KQML-like architecture and on an enterprise ontology.","","0-8186-8353-8","10.1109/DEXA.1998.707514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=707514","","Multiagent systems;Virtual manufacturing;Virtual enterprises;Market opportunities;Companies;Electrical capacitance tomography;Laboratories;Production management;Manufacturing processes;Collaboration","","4","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data points are associated with agents and deployed onto a 2D space, to work simultaneously by applying a heuristic strategy based on a bio-inspired model, known as flocking model. Agents move onto the space for a fixed time and, when they encounter other agents into a predefined visibility range, they can decide to form a flock if they are similar. Flocks can join to form swarms of similar groups. This strategy allows to merge the two phases of density-based approaches and thus to avoid the offline cluster computation, since a swarm represents a cluster.

"Semantic shared space-based complex tasks allocation method for massive MAS","Z. Brahmi; M. M. Gammoudi","URSIIVA Research Unit, Tunisia; High School of Statistics and Information Analysis of Tunis, Tunisia",2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology,"11 Sep 2009","2009","","","428","434","Task allocation is still a fundamental problem in multi-agents system (MAS). It allows coalition formation of agents in order to cooperate together to perform a complex task. In general, the task allocation process includes two steps: i) finding the set of agents that can, potentially, participate to task allocation process, ii) computing the optimal allocation to execute the given task. In this work further attention is given for the first step. Indeed, in the context of massive MAS, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous and a large number of autonomous agents, an efficient model of communication is required. This implies a need for a scalable and semantic infrastructure which allows: i) agents to be able to easily find each other and ii) semantic interoperability that refers to a common understanding of information communicated between agents. In this work information refers to an announced task. Different models of communication have been proposed, including broadcasting, forwarding, central server and group communication. Most of these approaches do not scale well in the context of massive MAS; when the number of agents grows. In additional, agent communication languages (ACLs), such as the KQML or FIPA ACL divide messages into several layers, and provide a specific syntax and semantics only for the outer layer, but its content is still arbitrary. To deal with these limitations, this paper extends our last task allocation method for massive MAS to shared space mechanism. This mechanism allows agents to find each by providing a logical shared space with temporal and special decoupling properties. To ensure semantic interoperability, we use a Task Ontology language (OWL-T) as a tuple space and a FIPA content message. OWL-T is based on the OWL for formally and semantically defining task in a high-level abstraction.","","978-1-4244-4519-6","10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234814","Task Allocation;Massive Multi-Agents System;Communication;Shared space;Ontology;OWL-T","Multiagent systems;Autonomous agents;Ontologies;Web services;Statistical analysis;Information analysis;Context modeling;Broadcasting;Mechanical factors;OWL","","4","","37","IEEE","11 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ghose","Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India; Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India",IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,"1 Aug 2022","2022","9","4","1249","1264","In this work, we mimic interactions among agents on social networks and examine their impact on the evolution of agents’ opinions. Each agent is entitled to an opinion represented by unit vectors of varying orientation. Agents are also characterized based on their inclination to alter their opinion and their susceptibility to the influence of peers with contrasting opinions. The agents constitute the nodes of a directed and time-varying influence network whose edges form their respective familiarity neighborhoods and govern their interactions. We also devise an interpersonal influence score to quantify the strength of the influence and the probability of acquisition, retention, or loss of a tie. This characterization of agents’ behavior and their interpersonal relationships differs from traditional bounded-confidence models based on the agreement in opinions alone. The agents with different traits form groups—liberal and conservative—distinguished by the distribution in opinions of their constituents. We analyze their interactions with different initial opinions, group compositions, network structures, and network evolution rates through simulations. The results reveal that flexible agents facilitate consensus among group members, while stubborn agents are instrumental in forming opinion clusters. This is substantiated by observing the average connectedness of the influence network and the average number of opinion clusters; groups with mostly flexible agents have better connectedness and fewer clusters than groups with stubborn agents in a majority. The simulations with stubborn agents reveal that new ties among agent pairs do not facilitate group consensus.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2021.3122137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597470","Influence dynamics;multiagent systems;opinion consensus;opinion neighborhood;social networks","Social networking (online);Resource management;Peer-to-peer computing;Instruments;Decision making;Social groups;Size measurement","","4","","57","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two continuous distributed tracking protocols are designed for tracking the virtual leader in finite time. Compared with the traditional distributed tracking protocols, the proposed distributed tracking protocols can reach consensus in finite time. In particular, to eliminate the chattering phenomenon occurred in non-Lipschitz dynamical systems, this paper introduces a saturation function to replace the original sign function in the proposed distributed tracking protocols. The improved protocols can guide all agents to track the virtual leader without chattering phenomenon in finite time for the same position. Numerical simulations are also given to validate the proposed distributed tracking protocols.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353228","Finite-time consensus;multi-agent systems;switching topology;tracking control","Protocols;Topology;Multiagent systems;Convergence;Switches;Network topology","","159","","38","IEEE","15 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As this form of face validation is useful for many multiagent simulations, it should be possible to setup such a system with as little effort as possible. In this context, we systematically analyse the critical issues that a realization of such a system raises. Addressing these problems, we finally discuss design aspects of basic framework architectures.","","978-83-60810-39-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6078267","","Visualization;Humans;Solid modeling;Data visualization;Adaptation models;Three dimensional displays;Animation","","1","","20","","14 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
