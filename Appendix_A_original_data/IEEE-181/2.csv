The selection of partners is one of the key factors for the success of virtual enterprises. Multi-agent system is an incompact agent federation composed of many agents, with its characteristics identical to virtual enterprises. It is, therefore, reasonable and effective to apply to the selection of enterprises' partner. The issue of trust is a hot topic in multi-agent system. The present trust model cannot well solve the problem of identifying the initial trust value of applicant agents. Moreover, there is room for improvement as to the calculation of agent trust value. This study puts forward a new trust management model based on multi-agent system. In the model, a fuzzy algorithm is used to calculate the initial value of the agent instead of a static definition. In addition, an independent validation module is used to test information reliability. Therefore, the problems of identifying initial trust value can be solved. Through system simulation, it is noted that based on the trust management model the cooperation rate has been enhanced and individual agent's income has risen by a big margin.","2155-8736","978-1-4244-4614-8","10.1109/NDT.2009.5272209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272209","Multi-Agent System;Virtual Enterprise;Partner Selection;Trust Model","Multiagent systems;Virtual enterprises;History;Information management;Feedback;Technology management;Testing;Fuzzy systems;Authorization;Production","","1","","5","IEEE","29 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is especially true for multiagent or swarm systems that require many agents working in concert. The total costs can be much higher when only physical prototypes are used for testing and analysis. There are existing 3D libraries for aiding with UAV simulations, but they’re too specialized; it is difficult to create highly customized virtual environments with these packages. A simulation development framework needs to be capable and stable for accurate simulations yet generalized enough that any types of simulations can be developed without exhausting efforts. This paper explores the feasibility and ease of using Godot, an open-source game engine, to develop a simulation that can assess the function of a multiagent UAV system. It is found that the Godot engine is a powerful tool that is both accurate and generalized enough to develop highly customizable UAV simulation. This allows verification and testing of UAV designs and control algorithms in highly customizable and flexible virtual environments, using a free open-sourced tool.","2993-396X","979-8-3315-2086-1","10.1109/SWC62898.2024.00346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10924963","component; 3D Virtual Environments;Multiagent Systems;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Three-dimensional displays;Costs;Accuracy;Virtual environments;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Libraries;Engines;Testing","","","","19","IEEE","24 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A software agent is used to reduce DIS traffic to efficiently utilize network bandwidth. It also performs protocol conversion between DIS protocol and a game engine protocol. Additionally, using a multi-agent system, our work is easily expandable to support several network environments and also to support agent-based intelligent operations.

The approach consists of a system of normative agents, which are physically present in a virtual society. The agents, which reason based on a BDI-model, use a number of techniques to detect various norm violations, including insulting and following. By using rewards and punishments, they try to reinforce the desired behaviour of the users. The system has been implemented and tested within a virtual environment for children between 6 and 12 years old, called Club Time Machine. In a real world experiment, the behaviour of the users of the virtual environment has been logged and analysed by means of a logic-based checking tool.

It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth optimization. To address these issues, we propose adaptive social metaverse streaming (ASMS), a novel streaming system based on federated multiagent proximal policy optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remain on local devices.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2025.3555419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10955488","Adaptive bit rate (ABR) streaming;extended reality (XR);federated learning (FL);multiagent reinforcement learning;social metaverse","Metaverse;Servers;User experience;Bit rate;Quality of experience;Data privacy;Blockchains;Training;Rendering (computer graphics);Headphones","","","","","IEEE","8 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We research a multiagent model in artificial intelligence and put our emphases on the structure of the team members. We analyze the hierarchical relationship among team members in the real world and apply it to computer generated team. In this approach, we present a hierarchical collaboration model based on the planned team activity model. The hierarchical relationship among the team members is organized as a hierarchical tree and each member of the team maintains this relationship. To maintain the hierarchical relationship, this paper also gives some atom rules and functions to adapt the dynamic environment. Using our improved model, the team can work effectively and dynamically in real time. The result shows that by using the hierarchical model the collaboration among the team members in the virtual environments is improved.","","0-7695-1931-8","10.1109/IAT.2003.1241111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241111","","Collaboration;Virtual reality;Virtual environment;Artificial intelligence;Collaborative work;Educational technology;Paper technology;Computer science education;Distributed computing;Large-scale systems","","","","9","IEEE","27 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agents are designed to help players learn skills and to evaluate performance. The framework has been designed with a close connection to the development of other system components: the Game Engine for creating the virtual world; the Narrative Engine for driving the story; and the Dialogue System for communication. In order to provide a synchronized, intelligent solution it is essential to adapt traditional designs for independent components to consider the system as a whole. Effective communication and synchronization between system components is created by introducing a new system element: the Translation Engine. In this paper we describe the Agent Framework and associated services within the Translation Engine. This includes communication to other relevant system components but the components themselves are treated as black boxes.","","978-1-4244-6332-9","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2010.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460172","Serious Games;Multi-Agent Systems","Engines;Project management;Humans;Communication effectiveness;Technological innovation;Visualization;Multiagent systems;Real time systems;Collaboration;Communication system control","","6","","19","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reasoning model constrains the recognition process by framing queries according to what a pilot would expect during the execution of the current plant(s). The importance of capturing relative information in these multi-agent simulations is emphasised, including self-aeroplane, aeroplane-aeroplane and aeroplane-environment relationships.","","0-7695-0625-9","10.1109/ICMAS.2000.858508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=858508","","Hidden Markov models;Aerospace simulation;Computational modeling;Instruments;Australia;Pattern recognition;Computer simulation;Virtual environment;Computer science;Software","","1","","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cases of directed fixed topology and switching topology are both considered. The protocols to ensure that the agents form the desired formation and track the virtual leader's velocity with extern disturbance are designed. Based on Lyanunov stability theory, the sufficient conditions that the protocols' parameters satisfy to ensure the error system's stability with the desired H∞ performance are presented. And it is proved that there always exist appreciate parameters satisfying the proposed sufficient conditions under desired topology condition. Finally, the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the designed protocols.","","978-1-4244-6712-9","10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5554066","formation control;distributed;H∞ control;discrete-time;multi-agent systems","Lead;Topology;Protocols;Multiagent systems;Trajectory;Switches;Simulation","","","","17","IEEE","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
