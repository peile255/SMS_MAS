An Approach for Integrating 3D Virtual Worlds with Multiagent Systems,"Education is incorporating more and more of the capabilities provided by the Internet. One such move is the incorporation of 3D virtual worlds in the learning environment. Another is the increasing development of multiagent systems that support the learner or the tutor. Integrating pedagogically based multiagent systems with 3D virtual worlds could provide a more engaging immersive learning environment. This paper explores the feasibility of integrating a 3D virtual world with a pedagogical multiagent system named QuizMASter, an educational game for elearning that helps students learn their course material through friendly competition. The integration was developed by devising, implementing and testing an approach using open source technologies, namely, Open Wonderland and JADE. The result is encouraging as the integration is technically feasible, not overly difficult and opens a door to further integration opportunities.",Education;Multi User Virtual Environment;3D Virtual Worlds;Multiagent Systems
Multiagent interactions in distributed virtual worlds,"Multiagent systems provide a valuable tool for handling increasing software complexity and supporting rapid and accurate problem solving. This paper presents a general architecture in which autonomous agents are embedded in a distributed virtual environment and are enabled to communicate with each other. We focus on the interaction issues, using cooperation and coordination patterns. Different cases of the agents' teamwork to improve their efficiency are investigated and compared. A prototype system has been implemented, with message templates and algorithms identified. Finally, some experimental results are given.",
"A rumination on human-centered automation world: multiagent system, human interface and people's lifestyle","The cyberworld or cybersociety of the future is discussed with respect to: (i) its significance, (ii) the infrastructure of such a world, (iii) the plausible configurations of a cybersociety which comprises an information community of virtual schools, libraries, factories, offices, communities and homes, etc., connected via the information highway, and (iv) people's lifestyles. Then, human interfaces, virtual reality and agents are discussed as the key technologies for realizing the cybersociety. Lastly, an interface agent of a virtual collaborator is proposed as a humanized intelligent interface agent system for helping with the operation and maintenance tasks of automated plants in the future.",
A multiagent architecture for distributed virtual environments,"This paper introduces a distributed virtual reality platform based on oRis, our dynamic and interpreted multiagent language. This platform, called AReViDis, has been designed for collaborative interactive prototyping. Thanks to the dynamic properties of oRis, we propose to let the designers of a system enter inside the system and dynamically build and modify the model. During an AReViDis session, this language allows the addition or the modification of virtual agents in a distributed virtual environment. These modifications may either be introduced by the agents themselves or by the users through various human computer interfaces. These modifications may also be received by the network allowing communications in shared virtual worlds.",
Transforming Learning through Agent Augmented Virtual World,"Recent years have seen new forms of immersive learning such as interactive storytelling in virtual learning environment. Intelligent software agents are able to provide a more attractive narrative and get the users more involved in the unfolding of the story line in the virtual world. However, designing and implementing a software agent or a multi-agent system (MAS) for this purpose requires the developer to be highly skilled in agent oriented software engineering (AOSE) and a large investment in time and effort. This raises the hurdle to develop non-trivial agent augmented interactive e-learning applications. Our research proposes a framework - the multi-agent development environment (MADE) - to resolve this problem by abstracting the agent implementation part into a reusable runtime environment so as to enable less technically inclined people (e.g. teachers) and developers with limited knowledge in AOSE to rapidly prototype a multi-agent system to be incorporated into interactive learning applications.",Multi-agent Systems;Agent-augmented Virtual Environment;Agent-mediated Immersive Learning
Intelligent Objects to Facilitate Human Participation in Virtual Institutions,"Our research combines electronic institutions and 3D virtual worlds for the construction of virtual institutions which are virtual worlds with normative regulation of interactions. That is, a virtual world where participants actions have to comply with predefined institutional rules. In this context, the actions a participant may perform depend on the institutional rules and the current execution state. We propose to include iObjects, intelligent objects, as entities having both visualization properties and decision mechanisms in the virtual institution. They are a new key element to improve users participation in virtual institutions. We situate them in a middleware infrastructure in order to be independent of 3D virtual world platform and to provide a general solution in which participants could be connected from different immersive environment platforms.",virtual environments;normative multiagent systems;virtual institutions;intelligent objects

The associated demonstration insists on the interactions between real world and virtual agents, the simulation of realistic physical environment.",simulation;real world multiagent systems;embedded agents;environment model
Multimodal interaction in a haptic environment,"In this paper we investigate the introduction of haptics in a multimodal tutoring environment. In this environment a haptic device is used to control a virtual piece of sterile cotton and a virtual injection needle. Speech input and output is provided to interact with a virtual tutor, available as a talking head, and a virtual patient. We introduce the haptic tasks and how different agents in the multi-agent system are made responsible for them. Notes are provided about the way we introduce an affective model in the tutor agent.",
NEXUS: Fusing the Real & the Virtual,"The aim of this project has been to create NEXUS, a framework that supports fusion of the physical and the virtual, creating a single world in which people can interact with deliberative agents in their own space. This work promotes a more orthogonal perspective for the development of artificial systems and their functionality as tools. This NEXUS becomes a place in which virtual and physical information spaces become entwined, resulting in the entities that inhabit this space being able to interact in a seamless fashion. The level of interaction envisaged is not simply a matter of people controlling the form of a virtual space, or even one of artificial entities that control the form of a physical space. Instead, we view the NEXUS as a fusion of physical and virtual spaces in which a number of entities jointly interact. This then facilitates the coherent integration of humans and the digital information space",Augmented reality;control architectures;multi-agent systems
Agent Architectures for Intelligent Virtual Environments,"This paper presents a new approach to integrate artificial intelligence in virtual environments. The system presented deals in a separated way the visualization and intelligence modules, applying in this last case a distributed approach (multi-agent systems) so that scalable applications may be built. Therefore, it is necessary to define agent architectures that allow agents to be integrated in the VW. Thus, a designer is abstracted from the peculiarities of interacting with a virtual environment. There is a first prototype of the framework using JADE as the supporting multi-agent systems platform.",
Collaborative prototyping in distributed virtual reality using an agent communication language,"We describe our work on multiagent systems in a distributed virtual reality environment. Our main goal in the LI2 laboratory is to make interactive and co-operative prototyping for well defined systems. Users and software agents evolving in our virtual worlds can interact, communicate and modify their behavior. The article focuses on the way our agents communicate in a ""natural language"" by exchanging information and knowledge. For this purpose we have developed a communication language based on ""speech acts theory"" and on agent communication languages (ACL). The Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) is the ACL we have chosen to develop high level communication among ""intelligent agents"". To validate our developments and thus the KQML specifications, we have tested them in a contract net application. Contract net applications use communication mechanisms based on offers, bids, contracts and so on, which can be designed by KQML message exchanges.",
Agent mediation and management of virtual communities: a redefinition of the traditional community concept,The paper explores the evolution of the concept of community in the light of computer mediated immersive virtual environments. The traditional concept of community has become strained in its attempts to capture the evolving virtual community. We believe the concept of the virtual community is of paramount importance and examine the extent to which this is being redefined to cater for it. We examine the management and mediation of such an environment and specifically the social process associated with the cohabited users. We advocate the use of multi-agent systems in delivering this functionality.,
Multirobot cooperation on virtual environment using Volunteer Based Cooperation Protocol,"We develop an experimental platform for heterogeneous multirobot cooperation which has both advantages of two evaluations means for multirobot cooperation, experiment with real robots and simulation. In this system, the real robots interact with the virtual environment and efficient evaluation of the multirobot cooperation in various kinds of work fields is possible. Volunteer Based Cooperation Protocol is proposed to reduce communication cost required in the multirobot cooperation.",multi-agent systems;multirobot cooperation;virtual environment system
Using a Declarative Language to Describe the Interactions in Virtual Scenes,"A generic platform useful to design and run virtual scenes as a result of a human-like description is introduced. The present article describes the operation of one of the main components of such platform: the virtual-environment (VE) editor. The main goal of the VE editor is to allow a human description of a virtual scene and translate it, if errors-free, into a set of low-level commands. The modeler is provided a declarative language useful to: a) arrange the virtual entities using geometric constraints instead of geometrical data, b) assign personalities to virtual humans, and c) specify goals to be fulfilled by virtual humans. A scene takes place in a specific world. For every different world to model a set of rules must be defined. The VE editor allows the specification of some features related to a particular virtual world, including the following: actions and skills that can be performed, virtual entities acceptable, pre-and post- conditions for interactions, effect of natural laws (gravity, collisions), and a set of rules, which reject or allow the assignment of goals according to the state of virtual humans",
Virtual sensors for dynamic virtual environments,"This paper proposes a sensor-based mechanism that allows virtual creatures to perceive the environment that surrounds them. We are keen on modeling the behavior of real-life creatures via VR-techniques. Every living creature is endowed by a number of senses, by means of which, the creature is aware of the world around. We picture the environment as a multi-agent system, where every agent has, primarily, a knowledge base, a sensors and effectors to allow interaction. The effectors may launch actions (graphical changes), noises, messages or aromas. The sensors model, particularly, the sight, hearing and smell senses of a living creature. Every sensor has specific perception capabilities and gathers partial or full information about the objects around. Through the sensors, a virtual creature is aware of the environment and capable to increase the knowledge base. The local state of a creature can be amplified by allowing cooperation between agents",

It also aims at capturing the daily activity of students, providing the basis for data-driven assessment. Finally, it also allows for using process mining technologies to unveil successful and failed behaviors of students enabling the teacher for an early detection and intervention to improve their learning experience.",Learning analytics;data-driven assessment;multiagent systems
A Multiagent Tool to Simulate Hybrid Real/Virtual Embedded Agent Societies,"Decomposing a real world problem into a multiagent solution and implementing the corresponding embedded multiagent system are difficult tasks. Agent models must be degraded in respect with resource constraints (memory, CPU) and energomic constraints. These constraints introduce deviations at two levels: the embedded agent and the whole system. This paper introduces hardware/software hybrid simulation of multiagent systems where real physical and virtual simulated agents cohabit. It presents the MultiAgent Hardware Software Simulator (MASH) and a discussion about our experience in using this tool.",embedded multiagent system;simulation
Intelligent Pedagogical Agents in immersive virtual learning environments: A review,"The concept of Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPA) has been an important research topic for a long time. IPA is supported by multi-agent systems research derived from AI. IPA provides personalized instruction, increase learner motivation, and act pedagogically on behalf or with the learner. On the other hand, virtual environments add value to the education process by giving new educational possibilities and computational-richness support. Combining both IPA and Virtual environments can make a promising approach for effective computer-aided learning. This paper provides a review on IPA and related topics focusing on a general overview of the topic, gives a detailed review in the application domain of virtual learning environments, and outlines a proposal for a flexible conceptual approach for the flexible application in different learning settings.",
The Cooperation Behaviors of Multiple Intelligent Virtual Agents Based on the Situation Calculus,"The behaviors of intelligent virtual agents displayed in virtual reality should be derived from theirs ""intelligence"". So we extend ConGolog to EConGolog by formalizing the belief and intention of agents under the framework of Situation Calculus and adding communication actions in the earlier ConGolog. Meanwhile, we propose a novel cooperation model of requirement/service and corresponding cooperation Semantics for multi-agent system based on EConGolog. We give a case of the multi-agent system to achieve the cooperation based on reason about action and performance of action among agents in the dynamic and incompletely known environment. In addition, we develop an animation description language ECGADL based on EConGolog. It can implement the animation of various complex behaviors of the agents more conveniently and flexibly.",
In The Truman Show: Generating Dynamic Scenarios in a Driving Simulator,"All the devices, animals, and people make their decisions based on what you're doing, but you don't know it or even notice it. Your world is that of Truman Burbank, from the 1998 movie The Truman Show. With this idea in mind, we've taken the movie metaphor to implement a prototype simulation system where the user steps into Truman's shoes. The set of our ""movie"" is a driving simulator, and the user is learning to drive a car. During the driving lessons, users drive in a virtual world that lets them experience all kinds of traffic scenarios. The system generates the scenarios with the student as the focal point, and the other traffic entities respond to the student's behavior, without the student noticing. To control the traffic scenarios and make them more effective, our prototype employs an agent-based framework. In this framework, each entity in the simulator is an actor agent playing a role. The prototype also includes a hierarchy of directors that directs the main action and the behind-the-scenes activity. The advantage of the movie metaphor is that it helps separate scenario description from scenario playing. The agents can read their required information from a script and perform their actions based on that information. Using this framework lets us build software that's extensible, maintainable, and easy to understand",multiagent systems;artificial intelligence;driving simulation
Interactions Between Agents As Shared Resources in Multi-Agents Systems,"In this paper we defend the advantages of a representation of agent behaviors, based on the concept of interaction. Although the behavior of an agent is usually included in its structure, we dissociate here the concept of agent from that of interaction, each one being associated with a specific ontology. This approach is especially valuable for increasing the reutilisability of the interactions, which are very often generic even in contexts where the agents are not. In a first part, we describe and compare our approach to the classic one. Then a list of properties is given to show the benefit to consider an interaction, not only as a communication means, but also as an entity shared by all agents and not reserved to some of them. An illustration of our approach is given in a road traffic application using VRML.",
Smooth migration from the Virtual design to the real manufacturing control,"The virtual manufacturing concept is based on the use of computational resources during the design of products and manufacturing systems, reducing the ramp-up time to market and the costs for the system's design, operation and reconfiguration. Combined with emergent paradigms for manufacturing control, such as multi-agent systems and service-orientation principles, and using a formal language to describe the system behavior, e.g. Petri nets, a truly and complete virtual production environment is achieved. This paper discusses this powerful approach to the virtual design and production environment driven by formal models, allowing users to design and deploy collaborative and reconfigurable automation applications in a faster and cost-effective fashion. A special attention is devoted to the process of migration from the virtual environment to the real world, aiming to reduce the transition time and increasing the efficiency of the process.",
Modeling Process of a Third Dimension Universe for Transportation Simulation: Application to Railway System,"In past years, 3D models of virtual worlds have been used in several applications such as urban planning, simulation and design. In the railway field, that we chose as a field of application to illustrate our proposals in this article, simulation makes sense because of the complexity involved and the risk for personnel during upstream phases of validation. To be able to simulation with enough precision, the model of the virtual universe is a key point. Especially For train component simulation, an accurate and detailed model of the train component is mandatory. For training the drivers within a serious game, a high visual quality is required. Obtaining a single model supporting these two constraints at the same time at the lowest cost is still an open issue and involved many actors. Our contribution is a methodology and a process for creating a virtual universe model, based on automatic model generation, in order to allow the creation of large-scale universes while guaranteeing a level of details appropriate to the need, a model of constant quality and including semantic data necessary for simulation, while reducing the modeling costs and the modeling duration. The proposed process is applied to train simulation.",
Behavioural realism of modelling multi-agent communication protocols in virtual environment,"This paper presents an advanced implementation of a virtual environment to develop and test communication protocols for multi-agent systems. This because virtual environments provide 3d simulation tools that allow for more realistic simulations. Embedding human capability into the control system software, the work considers the application of a multiple robots communication system. Current implementations of full-scale virtual environments to evaluate robotic applications is used for the purpose of simulating and testing the hardware whilst producing single-robot applications. The work presented in this paper exemplifies the use of full-scale virtual environments to test the communication between multiple robots. This implementation of virtual environments is shown to be efficient as it allows users to: a) greater understand the robots' behaviours under different communication rules, b) easier compare different communication techniques, centralised/decentralised and hybrid communications. Employing the virtual environment as a testing tool increases the efficiency of the evaluation process. The visual assessment outputs using a semiimmersive full-scale environment also has been advantageous in directing numerical analysis.",
Robot media communication: an interactive real-world guide agent,"Describes a guide system and the software architecture for an autonomous, interactive robot based on a multi-agent system. A robot navigation system has been developed allowing the robot to guide people through halls in various types of exhibitions. Our approach uses an infrared location system in the hallway ceilings, making the environment part of a sensor-distributed robot system. The real-world guide agent is composed of a guide agent on a hand-held mobile computer and a robot agent on an autonomous mobile robot. The guide agent plays the role of ""robot media"" in order to integrate information in the information space of the mobile computer and the physical space of the exhibits in order to guide visitors through the physical space. This research aims to develop a cooperative adaptive system using two-way communication among spaces, media and human beings to construct transparent knowledge boundaries between the real space and the virtual space. The virtual space is generated from computer data using shared space technology and it creates a distributed intelligence in order to manage the communication and control the guide in a laboratory. We have experimented with and verified this software architecture using a prototype autonomous mobile robot equipped with a compass.",
Collaborative shopping based on multi-agent in virtual environments,"Existing e-commerce applications on the Internet provide the users a relatively simple, browser-based interface to access available products. Customers are not provided with the realistic shopping experience as they would in an actual store or mall. So This work presents a collaborative shopping system based on multiagent that can provide the customers with simulation of the shopping experience in a real world. With the creation and application of the avatar in the 3D virtual shopping mall, the customers can change their role from ""hollow-man"" to human. By the combination of the sociality with virtual environment, the system can not only imitates realistic communication among special customers who are favorable to the same products but also realize the communication between multiple avatars.",

Research on multi-agent system based trust model of partner selection of virtual enterprise,"Virtual enterprise is the outcome of fierce competition in the world market. The selection of partners is one of the key factors for the success of virtual enterprises. Multi-agent system is an incompact agent federation composed of many agents, with its characteristics identical to virtual enterprises. It is, therefore, reasonable and effective to apply to the selection of enterprises' partner. The issue of trust is a hot topic in multi-agent system. The present trust model cannot well solve the problem of identifying the initial trust value of applicant agents. Moreover, there is room for improvement as to the calculation of agent trust value. This study puts forward a new trust management model based on multi-agent system. In the model, a fuzzy algorithm is used to calculate the initial value of the agent instead of a static definition. In addition, an independent validation module is used to test information reliability. Therefore, the problems of identifying initial trust value can be solved. Through system simulation, it is noted that based on the trust management model the cooperation rate has been enhanced and individual agent's income has risen by a big margin.",Multi-Agent System;Virtual Enterprise;Partner Selection;Trust Model

Simulating a Multi-Agent UAV System Coordinated by State Machines Using Godot,"Unmanned aerial vehicles have advanced quickly and are now a dominant force in several domains, including military, security, and even logistics. 3D simulations with virtual environments are cost effective tools for assessing feasibility and costs of developing new systems or upgrading current systems. This is especially true for multiagent or swarm systems that require many agents working in concert. The total costs can be much higher when only physical prototypes are used for testing and analysis. There are existing 3D libraries for aiding with UAV simulations, but they’re too specialized; it is difficult to create highly customized virtual environments with these packages. A simulation development framework needs to be capable and stable for accurate simulations yet generalized enough that any types of simulations can be developed without exhausting efforts. This paper explores the feasibility and ease of using Godot, an open-source game engine, to develop a simulation that can assess the function of a multiagent UAV system. It is found that the Godot engine is a powerful tool that is both accurate and generalized enough to develop highly customizable UAV simulation. This allows verification and testing of UAV designs and control algorithms in highly customizable and flexible virtual environments, using a free open-sourced tool.",component; 3D Virtual Environments;Multiagent Systems;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
UTSAF: a multi-agent-based framework for supporting military-based distributed interactive simulations in 3D virtual environments,"A military-based distributed interactive simulation (DIS) such as ModSAF has been used for many years. Several problems of the DIS-based simulation to support a large and heterogeneous virtual simulation environments have been discovered. To solve these problems, we propose an architectural multi-agent-based framework to support a large military-based simulation with 3D visualization using inexpensive game simulators. several software agents are used to support interoperability between DIS-based military simulation nodes and unreal tournament game simulators. A software agent is used to reduce DIS traffic to efficiently utilize network bandwidth. It also performs protocol conversion between DIS protocol and a game engine protocol. Additionally, using a multi-agent system, our work is easily expandable to support several network environments and also to support agent-based intelligent operations. Our main contribution is twofold. We use multi-agent system which is scalable to support our framework. In addition, our framework builds a simulation bridge that enables affordable high-quality 3D viewer node using affordable game simulations for military simulations.",
Supporting collaborative virtual meetings using multi-agent systems,"In an increasingly sophisticated global business environment there is often a need to be able to bring together professionals from all types of organizations from all over the world. Those professionals operate under severe time constraints and a conventional face-to-face meeting is both impractical and expensive. Virtual meetings have proved to be a convenient alternative, offering a flexible meeting domain more suitable for the busy executive. This paper explores the concept of using a peer-to-peer network and multi-agent systems to facilitate virtual meetings, managing the artifacts required for the session. By the use of a laptop, PDA or similar electronic device the meeting participant can join the meeting and collaborate in the discussion.",Virtual Meetings;Peer-to-Peer;Multi-agent systems;Collaboration
Designing and Deploying Real World Multiagent Systems Using Hardware in the Simulation Loop: An Approach and a Tool,"Designing a real world complex system requires to use decentralized artificial intelligence. Such a system involves self-organization techniques, advanced interaction models, real-time architectures... To simplify the design step, it can be necessary to reproduce the behavior of the whole designed system in a virtual environment before to deploy the designed application on the real world devices. In such a deployment, the used models must be degraded in respect with device constraints (memory, CPU) and other physical constraints (thermal dissipation, energy consumption...). This paper proposes a new approach and a tool to support such a deployment.",
Supporting Adaptive Virtual Environments with Intelligent Agents,"Adaptive Virtual Environments have been developed aiming at generating 3D environments adapted to user's necessities and interests. Navigation aid techniques and content adaptation improve user interaction in such environments. This article presents a system for supporting real time adaptive virtual environments. A multiagents architecture is used to manage contents updating in the virtual world according to user profile evolution. Its agents utilize the User Model, the Environment Model and a 3D objects database for decision-making on the necessary updating. A manager agent is responsible to accompany the user's actions through the user interface to collect information that may be used to update his/her profile. This agent also controls the communication between agents.",
A fuzzy evolutionary approach for collaborative clustering in multi-agent systems with application to emergent virtual organizations,"An approach to dynamic collaborative clustering in multi-agent systems is proposed. The approach determines the optimal configuration of an emergent virtual organization by clustering the best partners for each activity contributing towards the organizations' goal. The approach consists of two parts: 1) in a dynamic, ever expanding agent domain it performs an open evolutionary search for the best possible partners to be added to the organization; and 2) it uses fuzzy entropy minimization to continuously maintain the optimal configuration of the partnering agents in terms of their interactions to best fulfill the global goal of the organization.",
An infrastructure for providing communication among users of virtual cultural spaces,"Nowadays there exist several cultural spaces in the Internet and some of the real museums have been using it as an extension of their walls. A virtual cultural space can present to visitors any kind of artistic manifestation represented in a digital format. We propose a multiagent architecture used to enhance communication in cultural environments. Our proposal is based on a 3D environment where users are represented by avatars. Each avatar has a personal agent that captures all the relevant user actions. We have also others types of agent which are responsible for providing communication services. Also, we present a study case showing how these concepts were implanted in the ICSpace (Internet cultural space) environment.",
Learning with a context-aware multiagent system,"New technological developments have made it possible to interact with computer systems and applications anywhere and anytime. It is vital that these applications are able to adapt to the user, as a person, and to its current situation, whatever that is. Therefore, the premises for evolution towards a learning society and a knowledge economy are present. Hence, there is a stringent demand for new learner-centered frameworks that allow active participation of learners in knowledge creation within communities, organizations, territories and society, at large. This paper presents the multi-agent architecture of our context-aware system and the learning scenarios within multi-dimensional learning spaces that the system provides support for.

Intelligent pedagogical agents with multiparty interaction support,"Most current virtual world systems focus on the interaction between a single agent and the user. This simplification does not reflect the richness of a real social environment. The quantitative increment from the simple two-party interaction to a multi-party interaction does not merely increase the difficulty linearly. In fact, it leads to a much more complex situation involving multimodal communication, utterance understanding, and interaction style. Here, we introduce a four-layer agent architecture with multiparty interaction support. A Newtonian law learning environment based on this agent architecture is presented and how multiple agents cooperate to improve user learning is illustrated. The agent's interaction ability within a multiparty environment can be realized in three sections: planning and task execution, communication and understanding, as well as learning and coaching. Our entire system can be regarded as a step toward addressing and solving issues related to effective teaching in a multi-user environment within a sophisticated domain.",
NeXuS: delivering behavioural realism through intentional agents,This paper explores the challenge of delivering behavioural realism to embedded avatars. An agent based approach is adopted and demonstrated within a mixed reality (MR) environment. The realism of an avatar is driven by the state of the intentional agent that underpins its behaviour. The traditional disconnect often found with avatars that exhibit shallow levels of behavioural realism is no longer evident.,
"""Plug and test"" - software agents in virtual environments","James, a Java based agent modeling environment for simulation has been developed to support the compositional construction of test beds for multi-agent systems and their execution in distributed environments. The modeling formalism of James imposes only few constraints on the modeling of agents and facilitates a ""plug and test"" with pieces of agent code which has been demonstrated in earlier work. However, even entire agents can be run in James as they are run in their run-time environment. The integration of agents as a whole is based on model templates which serve as the agents' interface and representative during the simulation run. The effort which is put into defining model templates for selected agent systems obviates the need for the single agent programmer to get acquainted with the underlying modeling and simulation formalism. Instead, the agent programmer can compose the experimental frame and test the programmed agents as they are. The approach is illustrated with agents of the mobile agent system, Mole.",
A Normative Agent System to Prevent Cyberbullying,"Automated approaches to prevent the negative effects of cyber bullying mainly focus on affective agents that provide support for victims. The current paper takes a complementary approach, which attempts to minimise the amount of occurrences of cyber bullying in the first place. The approach consists of a system of normative agents, which are physically present in a virtual society. The agents, which reason based on a BDI-model, use a number of techniques to detect various norm violations, including insulting and following. By using rewards and punishments, they try to reinforce the desired behaviour of the users. The system has been implemented and tested within a virtual environment for children between 6 and 12 years old, called Club Time Machine. In a real world experiment, the behaviour of the users of the virtual environment has been logged and analysed by means of a logic-based checking tool. The results show that the normative agents have the potential to reduce the amount of norm violations on the long term.",cyberbullying;normative agents;BDI
Collective Operations as Building Blocks for Agent Cooperation,"Cooperation is the process of synchronization and exchanging useful knowledge between agents in multiagent systems. Since cooperation associates agents into a collaborative team to reach the overall goals of the systems, it is a crucial requirement for creating intelligent multiagent systems. This paper presents an approach for building complex cooperation protocols from simple primitives called collective operations. Collective operations are implemented in a new agent oriented programming language named Yaccai. The syntax and semantics of collective operations are designed to be effective for description of cooperation protocols while maintaining the autonomous computational model of agents. Our experiment shows that, collective operations are flexible building blocks for realization of cooperative multiagent systems.",agent cooperation;collective operation;agent execution model;multiagent system
MARL Sim2real Transfer: Merging Physical Reality With Digital Virtuality in Metaverse,"Metaverse is an artificial virtual world mapped from and interacting with the real world. In metaverse, digital entities coexist with their physical counterparts. Powered by deep learning, metaverse is inevitably becoming more intelligent in the interactions between reality and virtuality. However, it is confronted with a nontrivial problem known as sim2real transfer when deep learning techniques try to bridge the reality gap between the physical world and simulations. In this article, we use multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) to implement collective intelligence for digital entities as well as their physical counterparts. To model the immersive environments in metaverse, we define a nonstationary variant of Markov games and propose a recurrent MARL solution to it. Based on the solution, MARL sim2real transfer that bridges real and virtual multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems is successfully conducted by employing recurrent multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (R-MADDPG) with the domain randomization technique. Additionally, we use perception-control modularization to improve the generalization performance of MARL policies and make training more efficient.",Metaverse;multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL);multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) nonstationary Markov game;sim2real transfer

Adaptive Social Metaverse Streaming Based on Federated Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth optimization. To address these issues, we propose adaptive social metaverse streaming (ASMS), a novel streaming system based on federated multiagent proximal policy optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remain on local devices.",Adaptive bit rate (ABR) streaming;extended reality (XR);federated learning (FL);multiagent reinforcement learning;social metaverse
Collaboration based on hierarchical relationship,"In this paper, we present a technique for the collaboration among the members of computer generated action team in the virtual environment. We research a multiagent model in artificial intelligence and put our emphases on the structure of the team members. We analyze the hierarchical relationship among team members in the real world and apply it to computer generated team. In this approach, we present a hierarchical collaboration model based on the planned team activity model. The hierarchical relationship among the team members is organized as a hierarchical tree and each member of the team maintains this relationship. To maintain the hierarchical relationship, this paper also gives some atom rules and functions to adapt the dynamic environment. Using our improved model, the team can work effectively and dynamically in real time. The result shows that by using the hierarchical model the collaboration among the team members in the virtual environments is improved.",
An Agent Framework for a Modular Serious Game,"The architecture described in this paper provides emotional, believable agents for a serious game environment. Agents are designed to help players learn skills and to evaluate performance. The framework has been designed with a close connection to the development of other system components: the Game Engine for creating the virtual world; the Narrative Engine for driving the story; and the Dialogue System for communication. In order to provide a synchronized, intelligent solution it is essential to adapt traditional designs for independent components to consider the system as a whole. Effective communication and synchronization between system components is created by introducing a new system element: the Translation Engine. In this paper we describe the Agent Framework and associated services within the Translation Engine. This includes communication to other relevant system components but the components themselves are treated as black boxes.",Serious Games;Multi-Agent Systems
Enabling perception for plan recognition in multi-agent air mission simulations,"The potential synergy between instance-based pattern recognition and means-end (possible world) reasoning is explored for supporting plan recognition in multi-aeroplane air-mission simulations. A means-end-reasoning model is then used to deliberate about and invoke standard operating procedures, based on recognised activity. The reasoning model constrains the recognition process by framing queries according to what a pilot would expect during the execution of the current plant(s). The importance of capturing relative information in these multi-agent simulations is emphasised, including self-aeroplane, aeroplane-aeroplane and aeroplane-environment relationships.",
Distributed H∞ formation control for discrete-time multiagent systems,"This paper investigates the formation control of discrete-time multi-agents systems with extern disturbance. The cases of directed fixed topology and switching topology are both considered.

"Digital Twin in the IoT Context: A Survey on Technical Features, Scenarios, and Architectural Models","Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.",Artificial intelligence (AI);business models;cyber physical systems (CPSs);digital twin (DT);Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning (ML);multiagent systems;network function virtualization;sensors;servitization;smart city;software architecture;softwarization;virtual and augmented reality

Scalable HIL Simulator for Multi-Agent Systems Interacting in Physical Environments,"Important application domains of multi-agent systems require agent interactions in physical environments (e.g. mobile robotics, intelligent transportation systems, etc.). Sensing and sensory data interpretation play ever increasing role because sensing becomes the primary way of collecting information about the environment. In the most challenging cases the environment is unstructured, which results in demanding data interpretation and control algorithms. Similarly, the control and decision-making algorithms inevitably become more complex in order to be able to cope with the unstructured and dynamic environment. Consequently a sophisticated evaluation/test environment is required, which provides full control of the circumstances, reproducibility and flexible mix of real and virtual components. The paper presents the runtime architecture of a simulation environment (MARS), which assures scalable real-time performance and a modeling framework, which supports incorporating high fidelity sensor models. The tool is capable of simulating accurate agent interactions in physical environments and creating mixed virtual-real worlds for testing multi-agent systems",
Cognitive Perception in RAFALE-SP Methodology,"Several methodologies based on multi-agent systems (MAS) already exist. They help designers to describe software or to create MAS which aim at solving complex problems by simulations. Due to used formalisms, a methodology may be more or less generic. In this context, we have created a mobility oriented methodology called RAFALE-SP based on multi-agent systems. It helps us to describe mobiles which move on a space. This environment can be a virtual representation of a real space like a town where unpredictable events arise. We apply our methodology to solve problems which come from different research areas. We use it to find answers to geographical problems. The presented methodology begins by a conceptual representation of each mobile type and finishes by a mobility simulator. It uses several formalisms: UML and Ploom-unity. They allow us to define mobiles, their interactions and their environment. According to their knowledge, their behaviour rules, mobiles moves on a space by following few motion types. They get an individual perception of the world. In this paper we focus on mobile perception description",
Multi-agent Modeling of Biological Data Based on Virtual Reality,"Many applications related to various fields indeed require the use of temporal data referred in time. Unfortunately, the practical application of such systems is not achieved without difficulties. Complications of a technical but so conceptual nature generally appear. The spatial and temporal data present fundamental problems with the DBMS, not only because of the considerable size and the constant growth of these data, but also because of the complexity of the geometrical and topological relations between these data. From this, the spatio-temporal modeling represents many difficulties. The main goal of our work is to solve this problem in the biological domain and particularly the spatio-temporal modeling and visualisation of molecular and functional network. In order to do that, we propose a system based on multiagent system with the virtual reality allowing the user to interact with the three-dimensional image objects. As a computer-generated representation of a three-dimensional environment, virtual reality enables the user to view and manipulate the contents of an environment. Virtual reality is often referred to as the technology that gives a user the experience of being immersed in a computer-generated virtual world. Although virtual reality is a very useful application for examining and understanding complex data sets. In this paper, we started by the state of the art of the existing systems for modeling the biological data and their interactions (molecular and functional), then we described the multiagent architecture of the spatio-temporal modeling of molecular and functional interactions based on virtual reality techniques",

Autonomous agents and anticipative systems,"In this paper we propose an artificial intelligence approach to real time simulation of a virtual community based on a multiagent system. Our approach is based on the work of Holland and Miller (1991), in which the authors propose that the system may be viewed as a complex dynamic adaptive system with a large number of different kinds of agents. In such environment, agents may take their decisions based on the anticipation of the future state of the world (Axelrod, 1997). In this paper, we explore how useful the concept of anticipation can be for real time simulation improving and facilitating decisions of the virtual entities. In this paper, we work with real time anticipative agents and where developed situations, actions, and changes in the world. This normal context in a virtual world is taken as a framework where an agent is able to compare previous learned situations, executed actions and obtained results; with current situations in order to decide which action could lead the agent to a situation with the best utility or satisfaction degree.",Real time agents;Simulation;Classifier Systems;Anticipatory Systems.
Tokyo Virtual Living Lab: Designing Smart Cities Based on the 3D Internet,"The Tokyo Virtual Living Lab is an experimental space based on 3D Internet technology that lets researchers conduct controlled driving and travel studies, including those involving multiple users in the same shared space. This shared-use feature is crucial for analyzing interactive driving behaviors in future smart cities. The lab's novelty is two-fold: it outputs a semantically enriched graphical navigation network using free map data as input, and it includes a navigation segment agent that coordinates a multiagent traffic simulator. This simulator, which is based on the navigation network, supports the integration of user-controlled vehicles. The lab's approach can significantly reduce the effort of preparing realistic driving behavior studies. To demonstrate this, the authors built a 3D model of a part of Tokyo to perform experiments with human drivers in two conditions: normal traffic and ubiquitous eco-traffic.",human factors;artificial realities;augmented realities;virtual realities;Internet computing;3D Internet
Format-Store: A Multi-agent Based Approach to Experiential Learning,"FORMAT-STORE is a serious game application designed for training salesmen and managers in the context of a retail store or a larger supermarket. In this paper, we argue that a relevant way to train a salesperson to their daily activities (e.g. customer relationship management, store management and stock control) consists in immersing them in a 3d environment populated with realistic virtual customers. The first part of this paper presents the multi-agent approach we apply to the design of the intelligent customers. Specifically, we analyse the contribution of the interaction-oriented methodology IODA in facilitating the conception of a game for non computer-scientists by means of a user-friendly design tool and the automated implementation of the conceptual model.

It turns out that Immersive Face Validation, is a technically feasible process which offers great insight into the behaviour context of individual agents.",
Tiny Multiagent DRL for Twins Migration in UAV Metaverses: A Multileader Multifollower Stackelberg Game Approach,"The synergy between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and metaverses is giving rise to an emerging paradigm named UAV metaverses, which create a unified ecosystem that blends physical and virtual spaces, transforming drone interaction and virtual exploration. UAV twins (UTs), as the digital twins of UAVs that revolutionize UAV applications by making them more immersive, realistic, and informative, are deployed and updated on ground base stations, e.g., roadside units (RSUs), to offer metaverse services for UAV metaverse users (UMUs). Due to the dynamic mobility of UAVs and limited communication coverages of RSUs, it is essential to perform real-time UT migration to ensure seamless immersive experiences for UMUs. However, selecting appropriate RSUs and optimizing the required bandwidth is challenging for achieving reliable and efficient UT migration. To address the challenges, we propose a tiny machine learning-based Stackelberg game framework based on pruning techniques for efficient UT migration in UAV metaverses. Specifically, we formulate a multileader multifollower Stackelberg model considering a new immersion metric of UMUs in the utilities of UAVs. Then, we design a Tiny multiagent deep reinforcement learning (Tiny MADRL) algorithm to obtain the tiny networks representing the optimal game solution. Specifically, the actor-critic network leverages the pruning techniques to reduce the number of network parameters and achieve model size and computation reduction, allowing for efficient implementation of Tiny MADRL. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes have better performance than traditional schemes.",Metaverses;multiagent deep reinforcement learning;pruning techniques;Stackelberg game;UAV twins (UTs)

Disaster Evacuation Guide: Using a Massively Multiagent Server and GPS Mobile Phones,"The ubiquitous environment enables us to build systems that provide individual users with personalized navigation services in cities. In developing such a system, it is necessary to estimate the influence and the movement of its users and to get feedback. However, it is difficult to perform tests on such a system given the large number of human subjects involved and its scale, which matches that of a major city. One possible solution is proposed herein, the augmented experiment; it combines a multiagent simulation with a small-scale experiment performed with human subjects. In the experiment, the movements of agents that simulate users are shown to human subjects in order to give them the impression that the environment is populated with a large number of users. In this research, we build an evacuation guide system based on GPS-capable cellular phones and perform an augmented experiment wherein human subjects and evacuee agents are directed while the status of the simulation is passed to the human subjects. Interviews of the human subjects confirmed that the augmented experiment successfully gave the impression that a large number of users were present",
Multiagent approach for resource management in Smart Environments,"The dynamic nature of Smart Environments, enabled thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, requires the application of innovative resource discovery/selection services. Recommender systems provide useful and customized information, properly selected and filtered, for users and services. This paper proposes a multiagent approach for building a recommendation system in smart environments. Smart objects, enhanced IoT objects interacting among them and with users, are mapped through real-valued vectors obtained by word embedding techniques. The vectors are assigned to bio-inspired agents that, working autonomously, bring out a set of similarity grouped entities - clusters of smart objects with similar features - thus enabling an efficient and dynamic recommendation/selection system. Experiment results on synthetic and real datasets prove the effectiveness of the approach.",Smart environments;Word embeddings;Swarm Intelligence;Resource management
An Autonomous Layered Normative System Framework,"One of the main problems of normative system implementation is the semantic gap between the abstract norms described by natural language and the concrete norms described by operational language. This paper introduced an autonomous layered normative system framework which divided the normative system into three different layers. In this framework we realized automatic norm refinement by setting up semantic entailment relation and behavior responsibility relation, and automatic inter-level norm translation with action-operation mapping in the formal norm layers. With these mechanisms, the model effectively increased the system autonomy, with reduced normative system development cost and increased system reliability and dynamic adaptability.",Multiagent System;Norm;Layered Normative System
Interest management in agent-based distributed simulations,"Distributed simulation enables participants situated in different geographical locations to share a common virtual world, which is called a distributed virtual environment (DVE). Among the different research topics concerned with DVE, there is a current trend of linking multi-agent systems and DVE together. With the properties of autonomy, social ability, reactivity and proactiveness, agents can be used to represent entities in DVE, where fast and accurate decision making is a determining factor of the whole environment. This paper provides a description of integrating agents into an HLA-based distributed simulation. It focuses on how to construct the sensor of an agent with different interest management schemes. Using the JADE (Java agent development framework) agent toolkit and the high level architecture (HLA) in our prototype, a minesweeping game, we outline two different implementations of this game. Due to the dynamic characteristics of agents, a problem of overdue information from the environment is discussed, and we propose an enlarged subscription region method to solve this problem. Moreover, advisories provided by the HLA are adopted to reduce the overheads. Conclusions are drawn based on the experimental results of these implementations.",

Controlling anthropomorphic kinematics as multi-agent systems,"Building on existent robotics knowledge to model and simulate anthropomorphic kinematics is an appealing approach, because sound knowledge gained in the fields of multi-robot and multi-agent systems can be applied. This provides-with little additional effort-the ""new human"" with capabilities ranging from natural arm movement up to the coordinated operation of his arms and the cooperation between multiple anthropomorphic kinematics. The same general hierarchical control structure that has successfully been used to control multi-robot systems for space and industrial application has therefore been enhanced to incorporate the newly required capabilities. The enhancements focus on a new approach to on the one hand consider human extremities as articulated robots which are mechanically connected to make up the body-and on the other hand to provide a control strategy to move the full body correctly under equilibrium conditions. We provide an overall control structure that preserves the capabilities of the single robots and introduces ""sensible couplings"" to move the body as a whole in a naturally looking way. As described in the paper, this work is currently being applied to several application fields in industry up to the simulation of astronauts' work on the International Space Station.",
Formal Models in Web Based Contracting,"Legal principles have some difficulty to deal with software agents celebrating contracts and operating in e-commerce environments without direct human intervention. Autonomous intelligent agents have a control on their own actions and states, supporting or taking effective decisions. Therefore, some qualitative parameters such as trust, reputation and quality of information have to be taken under consideration to evaluate, certify and justify such decisions. Indeed, this paper shows how to construct a dynamic virtual world of complex and interacting entities or agents, organized in terms of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), that compete against one another in order to solve a particular problem, according to a rigorous selection regime in which its fitness is judged by one criterion alone, a measure of the quality of information of the agent or agents, here understood as evolutionary logic theories. This virtual world could witness the emergence of our first learning, thinking machines, that may cater for some issues on the evolution of formal models of the world in general, and on what is concerned with the objectives set to this work, in contracting, and foray into a vast, untapped technological market.",
Trust modeling in virtual communities using social network metrics,The paper presents the novel concept of trust evaluation method for autonomous multi-agent systems. The method is based on assumption that multi-agent system constitutes social network and so it is an instantiation of the complex network. Several metrics used in description of this type of networks can be used to model trust relation between agents. In the presented model the agent¿s A trust in an agent¿s B statements is obtained as the subjective logic consensus of modified trust levels of all agents that trust the agent B. The trust level modification is performed in relation to the current position of the agent in the network.,

Human-Centric Resource Allocation for the Metaverse With Multiaccess Edge Computing,"Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) is a promising solution to the computation-intensive, low-latency rendering tasks of the metaverse. However, how to optimally allocate limited communication and computation resources at the edge to a large number of users in the metaverse is quite challenging. In this article, we propose an adaptive edge resource allocation method based on multiagent soft actor–critic with graph convolutional networks (SAC-GCN). Specifically, SAC-GCN models the multiuser metaverse environment as a graph where each agent is denoted by a node. Each agent learns the interplay between agents by graph convolutional networks with a self-attention mechanism to further determine the resource usage for one user in the metaverse. The effectiveness of SAC-GCN is demonstrated through the analysis of user experience, balance of resource allocation, and resource utilization rate by taking a virtual city park metaverse as an example. Experimental results indicate that SAC-GCN outperforms other resource allocation methods in improving overall user experience, balancing resource allocation, and increasing resource utilization rate by at least 27%, 11%, and 8%, respectively.",Attention mechanism;extended reality (XR);graph convolutional network;multiagent reinforcement learning

In order to stay relevant to the demands and expectations of users in a Virtual Environment, agents must be able to adapt quickly and learn from other agents in order to perform well. The novelty of this paper lies in leveraging the potential of a new perspective of memetic computing and cultural transmission in a multi-agent environment through cultural evolution. This paper shares the concept from the perspective of not only vertically but also horizontal transmission of knowledge through memes selection, variation and transmission which calls for empirically verifying whether such a paradigm is viable for improving agents' learning capabilities in a multiagent environment.

A Multi-agent System for Dynamic Path Planning,"Escape route planning in emergency situations generates interest among researches in many different areas. Computer Science contributes to this by developing simulations of real world situations. An escape route can be regarded as a weighted graph where the labels associated with its edges are determined by the distance between two connected vertexes. Hence, given a starting vertex, it is possible to obtain the minimum path to one exit in the environment. Classical algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, can solve this problem. However, when the environment changes in real time, this class of algorithms is not efficient. Using Multi-agent Systems to solve this problem dynamically seems to be a good approach to plan escape routes in real time, given new information about the environment when modification are detected.

Intrusion detection algorithm in Smart Environments featuring activity footprints approach,"Discovering anomalous data or behaviors is fundamental to obtain critical security information such as intrusion detections, faults and system failures. The limited resources, like computing and storage, make conventional techniques to design Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) not particularly suitable for smart environments. This paper proposes a novel multiagent algorithm leveraging on devices activity footprints for intrusion detection in Internet of Things environment. Smart objects are mapped with real-valued vectors obtained through the IoT2Vec model, a word embedding technique able to capture the semantic context of device activities and represent these ones in dense vectors. The vectors are assigned to agents, which are spread onto a 2D virtual space, where they move following the rules of a bio-inspired model, the flocking model. A similarity function, applied to the associated vectors, drives the agents for a selective application of the movement rules. The outcome is the emergence of agent groups aggregated on the basis of the activities of their associated devices. Thus, it is possible to easily individuate isolated agents (i.e. devices with dissimilar activity from all), representing potential intruders or with anomalous behaviors to be monitored. Preliminary results confirm the validity of the approach.",Intrusion detection;Activity footprints;Multiagent systems;Smart Environments

Instead of having one central planner with complete information about the world, the concept of delegation is used. In this way, we achieve agent collaboration in a dynamic system, where each of the agents has its own partial plan, but the plans are implicitly coordinated towards a common goal. We demonstrate these techniques in a virtual reality simulation with virtual humans solving a logistical problem.",

A study of evolutionary multiagent models based on symbiosis,"Multiagent Systems with Symbiotic Learning and Evolution (Masbiole) has been proposed and studied, which is a new methodology of Multiagent Systems (MAS) based on symbiosis in the ecosystem. Masbiole employs a method of symbiotic learning and evolution where agents can learn or evolve according to their symbiotic relations toward others, i.e., considering the benefits/losses of both itself and an opponent. As a result, Masbiole can escape from Nash Equilibria and obtain better performances than conventional MAS where agents consider only their own benefits. This paper focuses on the evolutionary model of Masbiole, and its characteristics are examined especially with an emphasis on the behaviors of agents obtained by symbiotic evolution. In the simulations, two ideas suitable for the effective analysis of such behaviors are introduced; ""Match Type Tile-world (MTT)"" and ""Genetic Network Programming (GNP)"". MTT is a virtual model where tile-world is improved so that agents can behave considering their symbiotic relations. GNP is a newly developed evolutionary computation which has the directed graph type gene structure and enables to analyze the decision making mechanism of agents easily. Simulation results show that Masbiole can obtain various kinds of behaviors and better performances than conventional MAS in MTT by evolution.",Evolutionary computation;multiagent systems;symbiosis;tile-world
Multi-agent simulation for crisis management,"Traditional crowd simulators are based on a simple numerical analysis of inputs such as the positions of people and structures; they do not consider leadership. Since leaders (in terms of evacuations) are present in many real-world situations, the validity of evacuation simulations can be increased through their introduction. We assess the results of a real-world evacuation experiment to develop more realistic scenarios for simulation. The simulations produced by the improved scenarios are found to closely mimic the experimental results. This work shows that scenario-based agent systems such as FlatWalk and FreeWalk offer excellent promise in simulating evacuations more realistically.",
Multiagent-based security for the wireless LAN,"Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are being deployed in enterprises all over the world.

A multiagent-based system for WLAN security has been introduced. The proposed system directs the operations of the WLAN security products for use in WLAN vulnerability checks and responds quickly to security demands/threats. The purpose is to provide a way to inspect the enforcement of the WLAN security policy and to provide the administrators with an efficient way to revise any steps to ensure a powerful security scheme for their wireless networks.",
A Decentralized Approach for Anticipatory Vehicle Routing Using Delegate Multiagent Systems,"Advanced vehicle guidance systems use real-time traffic information to route traffic and to avoid congestion. Unfortunately, these systems can only react upon the presence of traffic jams and not to prevent the creation of unnecessary congestion. Anticipatory vehicle routing is promising in that respect, because this approach allows directing vehicle routing by accounting for traffic forecast information. This paper presents a decentralized approach for anticipatory vehicle routing that is particularly useful in large-scale dynamic environments. The approach is based on delegate multiagent systems, i.e., an environment-centric coordination mechanism that is, in part, inspired by ant behavior. Antlike agents explore the environment on behalf of vehicles and detect a congestion forecast, allowing vehicles to reroute. The approach is explained in depth and is evaluated by comparison with three alternative routing strategies. The experiments are done in simulation of a real-world traffic environment. The experiments indicate a considerable performance gain compared with the most advanced strategy under test, i.e., a traffic-message-channel-based routing strategy.",Autonomous agents;distributed control;intelligent vehicles;mobile agents;multiagent systems;navigation;software architecture;traffic control

Some agents, called active agents (AAs), which are attracted by the reference point (modeled as the virtual leader), lead the rest of the group to perform the task. Special features of our approach are that the group is not required to be initially connected and the AAs are not fixed as the system evolves. Two control strategies, each of which consists of an AA switching rule and the coupled flocking controller, are proposed to realize different kinds of connectivity as well as other well-known flocking specifications for the multi-agent group.",Decentralized control;multi-agent system;potential function;active agent
Consensus algorithms for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems using backstepping control,"This paper proposes two consensus algorithms for second-order nonlinear multi-agent dynamics. The objective of the algorithms is to guarantee two states of each agent reach consensus. Consensus is achieved asymptotically based on two “virtual states” in each agent. Both of the consensus algorithms use backstepping control to deal with the nonlinear section in each agent. By the first algorithm, the consensus is achieved for agent's models without unknown parameters under switching topologies. Adopting the adaptive theory, the second algorithm solves the consensus problem for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems with unknown parameters under a fixed topology. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",Consensus;Nonlinear dynamics;Tracking;Second-order
Modelling Large Complex Systems Using Multi-agent Technology,"The paper outlines a method for modelling largescale commercial, social, socio-technological and engineering problems. The method is derived from twelve years of experience in designing and implementing large complex systems for real-time scheduling of taxis, air taxis, car rentals, seagoing tankers, trucks, space crafts; dynamic data mining; dynamic knowledge discovery and semantic search.

Modelling of Complex Systems with AML as Realized in MIRO Project,"In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for a spatial complex system. The targeted system is the city with its mobility patterns. The goal of MIRO project is to study service accessibility in the city. In fact, we simulate the city with multi agent systems using them to represent each part of the system(individuals, buildings, streets,). The MIRO team is composed by scientists of several domains (computer sciences, geography or economy), so we want to construct a model of the city to share knowledges of each domain. The next step, we will use verification approach in order to validate the model and then the simulator because we want to generate simulator from model. Thus, we propose a method for modeling such complex system. This method is based on AML (Agent Modeling Language) that is a language well adapted for modeling multi-agent systems. We, then, present a spatial AML meta-model coupled with a method. The use case is the MIRO project.",Simulation;agenda;model;Multi Agent System
A Multi-agent based framework for Dynamic Service Discovery and access using matchmaking approach,Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has gained recognition due to its reusable nature of applications and interoperability between heterogeneous technologies. The basis of SOA is the service whereas service is a self-contained software module that performs a predetermined task. The most important tasks in building a service-oriented application are the creation of services with coarse-grained functionality and the creation of interfaces with the right level of abstraction that enhances service discovery and access. Dynamic Service Discovery is one of the key issues of SOA that requires new avenues of research. Agents are reusable s/w components that provide controlled/shared access to services and resources and forms the building blocks with collaborators called as collaborative agents for applications organized across various networks. This paper proposes a novel approach for a multi-agent based dynamic service discovery using matchmaking technique.,Multi-agent system;Service discovery;Matchmaking;Middle-agent
An agent based framework for urban mobility simulation,"Mobility study is composed of many research areas like urban mobility. In the literature, urban mobilities are represented by analytical techniques like stochastic laws or they are defined by simulation tools like multi-agents systems (MAS). The goal of our work is to define citizen behaviour in order to observe population dynamics by a simulation. This strategy is facilitated by a meta-model and a toolkit which are used with a particular method. The latter begins by a conceptual representation of each mobile and finishes by a mobility simulator. This paper aims at describing the mobility simulation toolkit. Thanks to this framework, mobility simulator development is simplified. It allows us to create distributed applications which are based on MAS.",

Mixed reality educational environment for robotics,"This work presents an operational setup for carrying out experiments in robotics using a mixed-reality approach. The objective of this setup is twofold, on one hand it aims to be a useful educational tool for teaching robotics and on the other it is a tool to help in the development and study of embodied evolution. The design represents an intermediate system between a real and a simulated scenario so as to work with real robots and to make easier and simpler the configuration and modification of the rest of the elements of the experiments. The present operational setup consists, mainly, of a video projector to represent the virtual elements projecting them over the arena of the experiment, a zenithal camera to capture the state of real elements moving on the arena, and a computer which monitors and controls the scenario. As a result, both real and virtual elements interact on the arena and their state is updated based on world rules of the experiment and on the state and actions of other elements. The scheme implemented in the main computer to control and structure this environment is based on the one proposed in a previous work for the definition of scenarios in a simulation environment named Waspbed, which was designed for the study of simulated coevolution processes in multiagent systems. Apart from the advantages provided in robotics research when large testing period times are required, this setup is used for getting students from engineering degrees used to deal with robotics and all its associated fields, such as artificial vision, evolutionary robotics, communication protocols, etc. in a very simple, quick and cheap way, which otherwise wouldn't be feasible taking into account the academic constraints of time and resources.",Learning environments;multirobots system;virtual environments;educational robotics;autonomous robotics;embodied evolution
Model of MAS: supporting dynamic enterprise model,"The advent of new enterprise paradigms of extended, virtual and agile enterprises presents new requirements on organizational concepts and supporting technologies. Inter- and intra-organizational relations need enterprise information systems (EIS) to support their establishment, deployment and discontinuation. This paper describes the model of multi-agent system (MAS) for supporting the dynamic enterprise model (DEM). It separates the business process from the organizational structure (organizational structure tier and business process tier), models each of them as MAS, and coordinates agents by ""yellow page"" mechanism. This model not only can regulate itself in terms of DEM, but also centers on the coordination strategies between the agents. It is believed that the model of MAS is a practical way to build flexible EIS.",
Agent-based digital libraries: driving the information economy,"Exploiting the enormous potential of the Internet will require distributed, scaleable, self-optimising software tools that are capable of pro-actively adapting their behaviour to meet the requirements of users with differing skills, interests, and objectives. We argue that an appropriate framework for building such software tools is that of an information economy, in which computational agents carry out the roles of information producer consumer and broker. We further argue that the emerging technology of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems provides the technological foundation upon which to implement such information economies, and provide the rich personalised information retrieval, management, and sharing services required to exploit the Internet. We illustrate our argument by describing, as a case study, the Zuno Digital Library (ZUNODL), a commercial framework for building commercial digital libraries.",
A Novel Parallel Control Method for Optimal Consensus of Nonlinear Multiagent Systems,"This work concentrates on the initial introduction of parallel control to investigate an optimal consensus control strategy for continuous-time nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) via adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). First, the control input is integrated into the feedback system for parallel control, facilitating an augmented system’s optimal consensus control with an appropriate augmented performance index function to be established, which is identical to the original system’s suboptimal control with a conventional performance index. Second, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is evaluated based on the policy iteration algorithm, and the convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated. Then, an online learning algorithm becomes available to implement the ADP-based optimal parallel consensus control protocol without prior knowledge of the system. The Lyapunov approach is employed to indicate that the signals are convergent. Ultimately, the experimental data support the theoretical results.",Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP);coupled Hamilton-Jacobi;optimal consensus control;parallel control
The potential of multi-agent systems in virtual manufacturing enterprises,"Manufacturers operate today in a constantly moving market, characterized by short product life cycles and increased demand for flexibility. In the same way, the ability to respond rapidly to changing market opportunities by quickly providing the required combination of design and manufacturing capabilities becomes a key issue to maintain competitively. In this context, the concept of virtual enterprise takes an increasing importance in supporting future business engagements and fulfilling technology requirements. As short-term consortia of companies to address fast changing opportunities, the virtual enterprise may be modeled by a multi-agent system representation. Such an approach allows modeling the heterogeneous actors of the real world in terms of agents, focusing on communication and collaboration between them. The feasibility of the multi-agent approach has already been demonstrated in the manufacturing and financial fields. This paper shows how a multi agent approach may be used in the modeling of virtual enterprises. An example of an agent, the ""controller agent"", will be described in details. The multi-agent system used, called PVS98, has been developed in the framework of an Eureka project. It relies on a KQML-like architecture and on an enterprise ontology.",

Multiagent trust management of web services: the “asynchronous computing environment profile unification methodology” (acepum),"Web services are considered as a major challenge for the information technology industry as they emerge from integration of several technologies adaptable within different architectures and platforms.

Can Artificial Life Emerge in a Network of Interacting Agents?,"An interacting multi-agent system in a network can behave like a nature-inspired smart system (SS) exhibiting the four salient properties of an artificial life system (ALS): (i) Collective, coordinated and efficient (ii) Self-organization and emergence (iii) Power law scaling or scale invariance under emergence (iv) Adaptive, fault tolerant and resilient against damage. We explain how these basic properties can arise among agents through random enabling, inhibiting, preferential attachment and growth of a multiagent system. However,the quantitative understanding of a Smart system with an arbitrary interactive topology is extremely difficult. Hence we cannot design a general purpose programmable Smart system. However, for specific applications and a predefined static interactive topology among the agents, the quantitative parameters can be obtained through simulation to build a specific SS.",

Animating groups of Socially Intelligent Agents,"This paper presents a multi-agent framework oriented to animate groups of synthetic humans that properly balance task-oriented and social behaviors. We mainly focus on the social model designed for BDI-agents to display socially acceptable decisions. This model is based on an auction mechanism used to coordinate the group activities derived from the character's roles. The model also introduces reciprocity relations between the members of a group and allows the agents to include social tasks to produce realistic behavioral animations. Furthermore, a conversational library provides the set of plans to manage social interactions and to animate from simple chats to more complex negotiations. The framework has been successfully tested in a 3D dynamic environment while simulation a virtual university bar, where groups of waiters and customers can interact and finally display complex social behaviors (e.g. task passing, reciprocity, planned meetings...).",
Development of crop-simulation multiagent system for smart digital twin of plant,"The paper discusses development of the smart digital twin of plant (SDTP) as an intelligent cyber-physical system that includes an open knowledge base and a multi-agent subsystem for planning and discrete-event modeling of plant growth and development, as well as forecasting crop parameters based on the knowledge of agronomists, which can be supplemented with sensors and plant growth management mechanisms. SDTP functions should provide continuous adaptive adjustment of the plant development plan for each specific field, depending on the changes in external conditions, so that the discrepancy between each digital crop models and the real crops is minimal. SDTP is designed to systematize and formalize expert empirical data of agronomists on the stages of plant growth and development and yield forecast. Currently, SDTP is implemented as a web service that integrates various data sources from the fields and plants, and provides users with a possibility to track the state of real plants, predict and simulate plant condition.",precision farming;plant cultivation;digital twin;multi-agent technology;knowledge base;ontology
A hybrid dynamical systems approach to intelligent low-level navigation,"Animated characters may exhibit several kinds of dynamic intelligence when performing low-level navigation (i.e., navigation on a local perceptual scale): they decide among different modes of behavior selectively discriminate entities in the world around them, perform obstacle avoidance, etc. In this paper we present a hybrid dynamical system model of low-level navigation that accounts for the above-mentioned kinds of intelligence. In so doing, the model illustrates general ideas about how a hybrid systems perspective can influence and simplify such reactive/behavioral modeling for multi-agent systems. In addition, we directly employed our formal hybrid system model to generate animations that illustrate our navigation strategies. Overall, our results suggest that hierarchical hybrid systems may provide a natural framework for modeling elements of intelligent animated actors.",
Reputation-Based Trust Network Modelling and Simplification in Multiagent-Based E-Commerce Systems,"In this paper, we present a description model of a trust network graph (TNG)-for multi-agent-based e-commerce systems, which is similar to the relationship network formed among people's transaction activities in the real-world. The method assumes that a multi-agent system in a domain constitutes a community and so the trust network is modelled by the means of a graph in the community. Several notations and regulations are defined in the description model of TNG. In order to sweep out redundancy information in the TNG and reduce the complexity of the trust computation, we propose the principles and the processes of simplification, the definition and the selection algorithm of optimized path for recommendation propagation (OPRP) in terms of the trust commonsense in people's daily life. The examples in this paper show that TNG can describe the complex trust relationships in multiagent e-commerce systems and help simplify the algorithms of the trust evaluation.",Reputation;Trust Network Graph;Mobile;Agent;E-commerce
Invariant Ellipsoids Method for Homogeneous Leader-Following Consensus Control,"The invariant ellipsoid methodology focuses on minimizing the invariant/attractive set for a linear control system subjects to bounded external disturbances.

Emerging Cooperation With Minimal Effort: Rewarding Over Mimicking,"This paper compares supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms for the emergence of cooperative multiagent spatial coordination using a top-down approach. By observing the global performance of a group of homogeneous agents-supported by a nonglobal knowledge of their environment-we attempt to extract information about the minimum size of the agent neurocontroller and the type of learning mechanism that collectively generate high-performing and robust behaviors with minimal computational effort. Consequently, a methodology for obtaining controllers of minimal size is introduced and a comparative study between supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms for the generation of successful collective behaviors is presented. We have developed a prototype simulated world for our studies. This case study is primarily a computer games inspired world but its main features are also biologically plausible. The two specific tasks that the agents are tested in are the competing strategies of obstacle-avoidance and target-achievement. We demonstrate that cooperative behavior among agents, which is supported only by limited communication, appears to be necessary for the problem's efficient solution and that learning by rewarding the behavior of agent groups constitutes a more efficient and computationally preferred generic approach than supervised learning approaches in such complex multiagent worlds",Artificial world;genetic algorithms (GAs);machine learning;multiagent;spatial coordination
Evaluation and design of online cooperative feedback mechanisms for reputation management,This research evaluates and analyzes existing mechanisms of online reputation systems based on cooperative feedbacks of past transaction information. We find existing popular feedback systems do not provide sustained incentives for sellers to behave honestly over time. We propose a new design of reputation system based on exponential smoothing. This mechanism is shown to be more robust compared to the existing systems. We relax the assumption of a static product value and have implemented a two-level exponential smoothing policy to process and aggregate reputation information. The simulation results show that the policy can serve as a sustained incentive mechanism for the seller.,Index Terms- Electronic commerce;online trust;reputation systems;exponential smoothing.
"The evolution of swarm grammars- growing trees, crafting art, and bottom-up design","We presented swarm grammars as an extension of Lindenmayer systems. Instead of applying a single ('turtle') agent to convert linear strings into 3D structures, we use a swarm of agents ""which navigate in 3D space and-as a side effect-place structural building blocks into their environment. The swarm grammars are used to specify how the setup of agent types changes over time. Additional agent parameters determine the agents' behaviors and their interaction dynamics. Both the grammar rules and the agent parameters are evolvable and can change over time-either automatically at replication and collision events among the agents, or triggered by external 'tinkering' from a supervising breeder. When swarm grammars are applied to concrete problems, constraints on the developmental processes as ""well as on the emerging structures may provide the basis for an automatic evolutionary algorithm.",
FlockStream: A Bio-Inspired Algorithm for Clustering Evolving Data Streams,"Existing density-based data stream clustering algorithms use a two-phase scheme approach consisting of an online phase, in which raw data is processed to gather summary statistics, and an offline phase that generates the clusters by using the summary data. In this paper we propose a data stream clustering method based on a multi-agent system that uses a decentralized bottom-up self-organizing strategy to group similar data points. Data points are associated with agents and deployed onto a 2D space, to work simultaneously by applying a heuristic strategy based on a bio-inspired model, known as flocking model. Agents move onto the space for a fixed time and, when they encounter other agents into a predefined visibility range, they can decide to form a flock if they are similar. Flocks can join to form swarms of similar groups. This strategy allows to merge the two phases of density-based approaches and thus to avoid the offline cluster computation, since a swarm represents a cluster. Experimental results show the capability of the bio-inspired approach to obtain very good results on real and synthetic data sets.",
Semantic shared space-based complex tasks allocation method for massive MAS,"Task allocation is still a fundamental problem in multi-agents system (MAS). It allows coalition formation of agents in order to cooperate together to perform a complex task. In general, the task allocation process includes two steps: i) finding the set of agents that can, potentially, participate to task allocation process, ii) computing the optimal allocation to execute the given task. In this work further attention is given for the first step. Indeed, in the context of massive MAS, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous and a large number of autonomous agents, an efficient model of communication is required. This implies a need for a scalable and semantic infrastructure which allows: i) agents to be able to easily find each other and ii) semantic interoperability that refers to a common understanding of information communicated between agents. In this work information refers to an announced task. Different models of communication have been proposed, including broadcasting, forwarding, central server and group communication. Most of these approaches do not scale well in the context of massive MAS; when the number of agents grows. In additional, agent communication languages (ACLs), such as the KQML or FIPA ACL divide messages into several layers, and provide a specific syntax and semantics only for the outer layer, but its content is still arbitrary. To deal with these limitations, this paper extends our last task allocation method for massive MAS to shared space mechanism. This mechanism allows agents to find each by providing a logical shared space with temporal and special decoupling properties. To ensure semantic interoperability, we use a Task Ontology language (OWL-T) as a tuple space and a FIPA content message. OWL-T is based on the OWL for formally and semantically defining task in a high-level abstraction.",Task Allocation;Massive Multi-Agents System;Communication;Shared space;Ontology;OWL-T

Vectorial-Opinion Dynamics With Familiarity Neighborhoods in Virtual Social Groups,"In this work, we mimic interactions among agents on social networks and examine their impact on the evolution of agents’ opinions. Each agent is entitled to an opinion represented by unit vectors of varying orientation. Agents are also characterized based on their inclination to alter their opinion and their susceptibility to the influence of peers with contrasting opinions. The agents constitute the nodes of a directed and time-varying influence network whose edges form their respective familiarity neighborhoods and govern their interactions. We also devise an interpersonal influence score to quantify the strength of the influence and the probability of acquisition, retention, or loss of a tie. This characterization of agents’ behavior and their interpersonal relationships differs from traditional bounded-confidence models based on the agreement in opinions alone. The agents with different traits form groups—liberal and conservative—distinguished by the distribution in opinions of their constituents. We analyze their interactions with different initial opinions, group compositions, network structures, and network evolution rates through simulations. The results reveal that flexible agents facilitate consensus among group members, while stubborn agents are instrumental in forming opinion clusters. This is substantiated by observing the average connectedness of the influence network and the average number of opinion clusters; groups with mostly flexible agents have better connectedness and fewer clusters than groups with stubborn agents in a majority. The simulations with stubborn agents reveal that new ties among agent pairs do not facilitate group consensus.",Influence dynamics;multiagent systems;opinion consensus;opinion neighborhood;social networks

Finite-Time Distributed Tracking Control for Multi-Agent Systems With a Virtual Leader,"This paper aims at further investigating the finite-time distributed tracking control problems for multi-agent systems with a virtual leader under the conditions of fixed and switching topologies, respectively. Two continuous distributed tracking protocols are designed for tracking the virtual leader in finite time. Compared with the traditional distributed tracking protocols, the proposed distributed tracking protocols can reach consensus in finite time. In particular, to eliminate the chattering phenomenon occurred in non-Lipschitz dynamical systems, this paper introduces a saturation function to replace the original sign function in the proposed distributed tracking protocols. The improved protocols can guide all agents to track the virtual leader without chattering phenomenon in finite time for the same position. Numerical simulations are also given to validate the proposed distributed tracking protocols.",Finite-time consensus;multi-agent systems;switching topology;tracking control

As this form of face validation is useful for many multiagent simulations, it should be possible to setup such a system with as little effort as possible. In this context, we systematically analyse the critical issues that a realization of such a system raises. Addressing these problems, we finally discuss design aspects of basic framework architectures.",

Caribbean/Q: A Massively Multi-Agent Platform with Scenario Description Language,"Making a truly useful massively multi-agent system is difficult since the actions of the full ensemble of agents cannot be controlled by designing just one agent. It is critical to control all the agents by using protocols that describe the interaction of agents and the environment in a top-down approach. We introduce a system that uses interaction protocol descriptions and has the capability of controlling hundreds of thousands of agents. This makes it feasible to realize a mega-scale navigation system that can assist the inhabitants of a small city. In developing a massively multiagent system, protocol design and agent development need to be separated to allow specialists to work in concert with one another while honing the different technologies. As a platform for mega-scale navigation system, we devise an architecture for multiagent platforms where the execution of agents scenario and the implementation of agents are explicitly separated. This paper also gives the evaluation and an application example using the platform.",

Disaster Assistance Intelligent Agent,"Virtual characters are controlled by artificial intelligence in video games and movies. Controlling these characters when they are surrounded by people is known as crowd simulation. In this work, we propose to employ intelligent agents and decision trees to simulate a realistic scenario in which our agent will lead the human behavioural AI and identify the best route to the goal or the best circumstances to the objective avoiding all the obstacles in the path. This crowd simulation will be used to make intelligent agents which can find the best path during the situation of any disaster and show humans the safest path which the humans can follow to get to the nearest safe points. Multiagent simulation, commonly referred to as a Crowd and Agent Simulation, is an approach used to simulate many people, animals or other characters interacting with each other in one place. These actors are expected to pursue their objectives, engage in the environment and coordinate with each other. It is expected that the simulated actors will pursue their goals, interact with the environment, and communicate among themselves.

Towards a Generic Approach for Analyzing the Efficiency of Complex Networks,"A generic multi-agent model of a process industry is presented. The model is based on the system decomposition of a chemical process industry sector. The resulting system description was translated to a suitable analogy: a production chain for chocolate bars. Using this analogy a game has been developed and played to elucidate and explain complexities and interdependencies in the corresponding industrial network.

Cooperative Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Computation Offloading in Digital Twin Cyber–Physical–Social System,"The widespread deployment of edge computing infrastructures has greatly advanced cyber–physical–social systems (CPSSs) by enabling computation offloading for various applications. However, the heterogeneous nature of edge servers (ESs) and the single-destination offloading strategy may limit the overall network performance. In this case, tasks are exclusively handled by the administrative ES, resulting in only marginal improvements in service quality, such as energy consumption and task delay. To fully exploit the advantages of edge computing, this article investigates the cooperation among ESs within CPSS and proposes a cooperative algorithm, named MATORA, to exploit a further performance gain by calculating the task offloading and resource allocation decisions. First, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a time-varying mixed integer nonlinear programming problem; then, we utilize the multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to learn the action policy. Second, the MATORA novelly builds reputation model for each ES to obtain insightful knowledge based on service quality, enhancing the training efficiency of MADRL. Thirdly, we simulate a digital twin-based virtual system to monitor the physical network, in which a risk-free, centralized training environment is provided for the multiagent algorithm. Finally, the simulation results and analysis directly validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",Cooperative computation offloading;digital twin (DT);multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL);reputation model
Understanding the Interplay of Model Complexity and Fidelity in Multiagent Systems via an Evolutionary Framework,"Modern video games come with highly realistic graphics enabling the players to interact with visually rich virtual worlds. Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas-simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.",Complexity;fidelity;level of detail artificial intelligence (LOD AI);multiagent systems;multiobjective optimization
Blockchain-Empowered Resource Allocation in HAPS-assisted IoV Digital Twin Networks: A Federated DRL Approach,"Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a new paradigm in smart cities with the potential to provide and manage resources such as computing and storage closer to resourceconstrained smart vehicles (SV) to support ultra-reliable lowlatency communications and knowledge sharing. However, it is challenging to make optimal resource allocation and offloading decisions due to the mobility, ubiquitous communications, and diverse resource demands of SVs and the dynamic nature of the vehicular network topology. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation and task offloading scheme for HAPS-assisted Internet of Vehicle networks by exploiting the potential of digital twins (DT), blockchain, and federated multiagent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL) technologies to address these issues. The DT network is utilized to intelligently monitor and control the demand and supply of resources in the digital representation of the physical operating environment. We adopt a dynamic pricing-based double auction to model the supplies and demands of resource providers and requesters. This enables resource providers and SVs to make adaptive and optimal resource allocation and task offloading decisions. In addition, we deploy a consortium blockchain to enable distributed and secure resource allocation. The resource allocation and task offloading multi-objective optimization problem is formulated as a multiagent extension of the Markov decision process and solved using an FMADRL-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FMADDPG) algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme archives efficient resource allocation and maximizes the utility function while minimizing costs compared to the baseline schemes.",Blockchain;digital twin;resource allocation;task offloading;smart vehicles;deep reinforcement learning;federated learning;double auction
Communication overlays and agents for dependable smart power grids,"Smart grids rely on a dependable information infrastructure for the monitoring and control applications. Two elements can enhance the suitability of the communication and control infrastructure for such smart grid applications.

Blockchain-Based Pseudonym Management for Vehicle Twin Migrations in Vehicular Edge Metaverse,"Driven by the great advances in metaverse and edge computing technologies, vehicular edge metaverses are expected to disrupt the current paradigm of intelligent transportation systems. As highly computerized avatars of vehicular metaverse users (VMUs), the vehicle twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are high-efficiency and cost-effective, showcasing their promising applications in vehicular edge metaverses.",Cross-chain;deep reinforcement learning;pseudonym management;twin migration;vehicular metaverse

SDISSASA: A Multiagent-Based Web Mining via Semantic Access to Web Resources in Enterprise Architecture,"Distributed intelligent software agents (DISA) are software agents that help out users and act on their behalf. Such agents might be robots or virtual software systems.

Educational autonomous robotics setup using mixed reality,"This paper is concerned with the presentation of a mixed-reality operational environment for carrying out experiments in robotics. This set up was designed as an intermediate system between a real and a simulated scenario in order to work with real robots and to ease and simplify the configuration and modification of the rest of the elements of the experiments. The environment uses video projection over the arena of the experiment, image capture to obtain the current position of the robots and a computer which monitors and controls the scenario. The graphic representation of the virtual elements of the scenario is projected onto the arena and their state is updated based on world rules of the experiment and on the state and actions of the robots. The scheme followed to control and structure this environment is based on the one proposed in a previous work for the creation of a simulation environment named Waspbed, which was designed for the study of simulated coevolution processes in multiagent systems.

A Behavior-Authoring Framework for Multiactor Simulations,"Interest has been growing in the behavioral animation of autonomous actors in virtual worlds. However, authoring complicated interactions between multiple actors in a way that balances control flexibility and automation remains a considerable challenge. A proposed behavior-authoring framework gives users complete control over the domain of the system: the state space, action space, and cost of executing actions. To specialize actors, the framework uses effect and cost modifiers, which modify existing action definitions, and constraints, which prune action choices in a state-dependent manner. The framework groups actors with common or conflicting goals to form a composite domain, and a multiagent planner generates complicated interactions between multiple actors. The Web extra is a video that shows how multiactor simulations should aim to strike a happy medium between the automation of generation and the flexibility of specification.",crowds;high-level behaviors;coordination;authoring;virtual worlds;computer graphics;graphics and multimedia
Distributed Resource Optimization With Blockchain Security for Immersive Digital Twin in IIoT,"Virtual reality-embedded digital twin (VR-DT) service integrates digital twin with virtual reality to visualize the digital representation of real-world production, boosting the digital transformation of manufacturing industry in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Balanced against the advantages of the VR-DT service, its data-driven, computing-intensive, and security-sensitive features bring challenges to the current IIoT. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed resource allocation scheme to improve the average Quality of Service (QoS) of the VR-DT services with regard to service delay and transaction throughput. We formulate the joint optimization of channel assignment, subframe configuration, computing capacity allocation, and block size adjustment as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem.

A Multi Agent Simulator for Disaster Prevention and First Response Applications,"The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has exponentially grown in the last decades thanks to their versatility and ease of use. However, deploying a single large drone might not be efficient for completing tasks compared to the use of a heterogeneous swarm of smaller and lighter drones, which can better adapt to different application scenarios and reduce the mission time. In this sense, Search and Rescue (SAR) activities represent an important field of application. Heterogeneous multiagent systems require ad-hoc Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) algorithms to effectively manage the agents of the swarm. Hence, there is a need for an efficient simulator that allows for the validation of such GNC techniques, taking advantage of the positive aspects of a risk-free virtual environment before realworld deployment. In this sense, the main aim of this paper is to propose a heterogeneous Simulink-based multi-agent flight simulator that is able to support researchers in the representation of realistic scenarios before effectively conducting real tests. The effectiveness of the proposed simulator, which is part of the project “CHeMSys: Cooperative Heterogeneous Multi-drone System for disaster prevention and first response,” is evaluated in several scenarios, considering ground, water, and air vehicles.",coordinated feasible trajectory planning;multirobot systems;surveillance missions;set-theoretic approach

In this context, building scenarios related to the growing of existent slums, the birth of new ones, and their evolution, would be very useful for urban planning and for the elaboration of social policies aiming to minimize the impact caused by the uncontrolled growing of slums.",

Scalable Consensus Over Finite Capacities in Multiagent IoT Ecosystems,"In the real world, consensus achievement is an adaptive and evolutionary process. Tailor-made mechanisms are engaging in the light of disputes to resolve emerging contradictions between the atoms. Most of the dominant blockchain architectures tend to oversee this fact. They come integrated with rigid, overkilling consensus-achievement procedures, which, in many cases, are not necessary or significantly beneficial. They often raise overwhelming demands on the nodes and prohibit the deployment of fully distributed and peer blockchain operation in the IoT world. Still, for the IoT ecosystems and the metaverse to become self-sustainable and self-evolving, robust validity mechanisms must be embedded in the atomic scale. This work investigates the process of building and sustaining scalable consensus policies over the trivial atomic capacities of the IoT ecosystems. For this, we deploy the IoT microblockchain framework as an atomic consistency tier and we define a primary set of validity rules that every node can easily carry out. The initial concept relies on Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and K. Friston’s free energy principle and is investigated under the perspectives of graph and game theory. To study the dynamic behavior of the system, a competitive game among the nodes is run. The Proof of Existence (PoE) is utilized as a universal proofing case. Its feasibility is demonstrated, and its complexity is analyzed under various system considerations. The findings prove that finite-capacity atoms can collectively and efficiently support verifiable validity and scalable consensus in the evolutionary IoT ecosystems and the metaverse, even under conditions of high diversity, trivial capacity, and eventual consistency.",Artificial intelligence (AI)-intensive multiagent systems;evolutionary systems;IoT microblockchain;IoT sustainable transactional trust;peer IoT ecosystems;rational metaverse;reality modeling;scalable consensus;validity in IoT ecosystems
A light-weighted multiagent-based crowd simulation,"The main contributions of this research include developing a light-weighted multiagent-based system for crowd simulation and modeling bounded rationality of the agents in such system. We deploy the belief-desire-intention (BDI) concept to model our agents. Whereas most works in the field assume perfect information, we take into account the bounded rationality characteristics of human beings into the perception of agents. We found that the increasing number of agents affects the performance by increasing duration, number of rounds, duration per round, duration per agent, and round per agent in two dense scenes. However, the perception process added on does not directly affect the performance of the algorithm. With regards to the behavior of the agents, we found that most agents are affected by the increasing number of agents that their paths divert significantly from the original plan. However, there are some agents which apparently can maintain their paths close to their original ones.",agent-based simulation;crowd simulation

CARAVAN: Congestion Avoidance and Route Allocation Using Virtual Agent Negotiation,"Traffic congestion becomes a cascading phenomenon when vehicles from a road segment chaotically spill on to successive road segments. Such uncontrolled dispersion of vehicles can be avoided by evenly distributing vehicles along alternative routes. This paper proposes a practical multiagent-based approach, which is designed to achieve acceptable route allocation within a short time frame and with low communication overheads. In the proposed approach, which is called Congestion Avoidance and Route Allocation using Virtual Agent Negotiation (CARAVAN), vehicle agents (VAs) in the local vicinity communicate with each other before designated decision points (junctions) along their route. Cooperative route-allocation decisions are performed at these junctions. VAs use intervehicular communication to propagate key traffic information and undertake its distributed processing. Every VA exchanges its autonomously calculated route preference information to arrive at an initial allocation of routes. The allocation is improved using a number of successive virtual negotiation “deals.” The virtual nature of these deals requires no physical communication and, thereby, reduces communication requirements. In addition to the theory and concept, this paper presents the design and implementation methodology of CARAVAN, including experimental results for synthetic and real-world road networks. Results show that when compared against the shortest path algorithm for travel time improvements, CARAVAN offers 21%-43% gain (when traffic demand is below network capacity) and 13%-17% gain (when traffic demand exceeds network capacity), demonstrating its ability to regulate overall system traffic using local coordination strategies.",Cooperative systems;dynamic traffic assignment;multiagent systems (MAS);traffic congestion management
A Multi-agent Approach Toward the Security Analysis of the 802.11i Handshake Protocol,"Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are now increasingly deployed because of their low up-front cost, easy network maintenance, robustness, and reliable self coverage. It is important to guarantee the security properties of the WMN to ensure a desired secure system. In this paper, we formally verify the authentication of a WMN. We start with translating a WMN into a multi-agent system (MAS), where each node represents an agent of the MAS. The purpose is to benefit from the existing state-of-the-art verification techniques applicable in the multi-agent domain. We then prove the authentication property of the WMN. Our contributions include: translating a wireless mesh network into a formal multi-agent framework, representing the authentication property as MAS's formal specification, and applying the strand system verification strategy to prove the correctness of MAS's authentication",
MDSM: Generalized multiagent coordination for demand side management,"One key challenge in creating a sustainable society is to make consumer demand adaptive to the supply of electricity. We propose a generalization for the multiagent coordination algorithm for partially-centralized demand side management. In this setting, a central unit buys the electricity for the whole group, while the individual agents make their own demand decisions, based on their private constraints and preferences. While the state-of-the-art algorithm achieves strong guarantees, i.e., efficiency, strict budget balance as well as weak incentive compatibility, the formulation requires a simple supply model with a 2-step increasing threshold price function. In this paper, we propose MDSM, a generalized formulation of the multiagent coordination algorithm and prove that it converges to the optimal solution for all convex piecewise linear cost functions. Further, we perform simulations based on real world consumption data to evaluate the scalability of the algorithm in respect to the number of thresholds. The results indicate that the convergence time of MDSM is not sensitive to the number of thresholds in the cost function. This means, the proposed algorithm could be used for a broader set of distributed scheduling problems.",
Distributed Pursuit-Evasion Game of Limited Perception USV Swarm Based on Multiagent Proximal Policy Optimization,"This article proposes a distributed capture strategy optimization method for the pursuit-evasion game involving multiple unmanned surface vehicles.

Moreover, to facilitate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit feature network is constructed to extract the fixed-length vector representations from the variable-length observation sequences. In terms of the policy training, by employing virtual barriers and curriculum learning techniques during the training process, the generalization capabilities and convergence speed of the policy have been further improved. Finally, our method is compared with the other DRL methods through the comparative simulation experiments and virtual reality scene testing based on the gazebo three dimensional physics engine, verifying its significant advantages in the policy convergence speed, capture efficiency, and generalization capabilities.",Curriculum learning;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);pursuit-evasion (PE) game;unmanned surface vehicle (USV) swarm

An approach for testing mobile agents using the nets within nets paradigm,"Among all the different architectures being researched in the field of multi-agent systems, the mobile agent has shown to be one of the most challenging and most critical systems. With more applications being developed, there is a need to ensure large and complicated mobile agent systems are functioning correctly, with minimum or no errors. Moreover, the model-based testing technique has gained attention with the popularization of models in software design and development. Since the paradigm on nets within nets is well suited to express the dynamics of open mobile agents, it is retained as an abstract model from which abstract test cases are generated. Those test cases are then concretized and addressed to the system under test. The responses of the system under test are, finally, compared to the expected results derived from the abstract test model.

A Tree-Structured Intelligence Entity Pool and Its Sharing among Ubiquitous Objects,"With the rapid advancing in electronics, VLSI, and nanotechnology, ubiquitous devices (u-objects) like mobile devices, sensing devices, RFID devices, IC cards, wireless devices, wireless wearable devices, etc. are getting more and more in number, smaller and smaller in size, and even invisible in form. In order to make them work without human involved and interaction, there is necessity of enabling them with intelligent, smart, or autonomic computing capabilities. Of course, intelligent function embedded is a straightforward approach. However, it may be difficult for the tiny devices to embed the intelligent computing capabilities due to their limited capacity and processing power. For a multiple intelligent agents system, it is not efficient to develop and maintain intelligent computing functions for each individual agent. Therefore, the idea is to design an intelligence entity sharing pool in which a requested intelligence entity can be dynamically composed from a number of atomic intelligence entities and complex intelligence entities residing in the intelligence entity pool and posted to virtual objects (v-object) in the v-object server for sharing by ubiquitous devices in the real world. This research is of three main phases: designing the intelligence entity sharing pool; mapping u-objects to virtual objects (v-objects); and developing a framework for intelligence entity sharing.

Self-interested agents may find it rational to cheat others in the market. The authors have modeled federations of digital libraries selling information to one another. In the model, cooperation emerges through endogenous incentives. They had hypothesized that a number of factors would encourage cooperation: greater familiarity with trading partners, more memory for modeling others, fewer initially misbehaving agents, lower rates of strategy exploration, smaller world sizes, and more rapidly evolving measures of the likelihood of other agents to cooperate. The simulations confirmed many of the hypotheses. However the benefits of a small world size are dependent on memory size, and the usefulness of rapidly evolving estimates of cooperation is dependent on the types of strategies employed by the agents. They suggest that it will become increasingly important to allow agents conceptually to carve their networked environment into subcommunities where familiarity and trust can emerge, as opposed to promoting indiscriminate interactions within a large society of digital agents.",
A Combined Reputation Model for Distributed System,"As more and more people enter into the virtual world based on the internet, reputation has become the key to punish the bad behaviors of people and encourage the good behaviors of them. How to evaluate effectively the reputation of the participators is the urgent problem which should be solved. The paper provides a combined reputation model TRUST for distributed environment. This model, according to the characteristics of internet, is based on the direct and indirect experience of service consumer to the service provider. It combines the merits of centralized evaluation and distributed evaluation through binding the centralized reputation and distributed reputation mechanism. Centralized reputation mechanism is used in communities; distributed reputation mechanism is used among communities. Simulating experiments prove this model can give service consumer more profit, thus adapting to the distributed system circumstance better.",
Multi-agent system based regional data grid,"Grids are increasingly being used in applications, one of which is e-learning. As most of business and academic institutions (universities) and training centres around the world have adopted this technology in order to create, deliver and manage their learning materials through the Web, the subject has become the focus of investigate. Still, collaboration between these institutions and centres is limited. Existing technologies such as grid, Web services and agents are promising better results. In this paper we support building our architecture Regionally Distributed Architecture for Dynamic e-Learning Environment (RDADeLE) by using agent technology (Multi-Agent System) using Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE). By describing these agents in details, we prove that agents can be implemented to work well to extend the autonomy and interoperability for regional data grid.",Data grid;Regional grid;Multi-Agent System (MAS);JADE;E-learning;Intelligent;Autonomous;Distributed data grid;Learning Objects (LO);Search
Predictive Multi-Agent-Based Planning and Landing Controller for Reactive Dual-Arm Manipulation,"Future robots operating in fast-changing anthropomorphic environments need to be reactive, safe, flexible, and intuitively use both arms (comparable to humans) to handle task-space constrained manipulation scenarios. Furthermore, dynamic environments pose additional challenges for motion planning due to a continual requirement for validation and refinement of plans. This work addresses the issues with vector-field-based motion generation strategies, which are often prone to local-minima problems. We aim to bridge the gap between reactive solutions, global planning, and constrained cooperative (two-arm) manipulation in partially known surroundings. To this end, we introduce novel planning and real-time control strategies leveraging the geometry of the task space that are inherently coupled for seamless operation in dynamic scenarios. Our integrated multiagent global planning and control scheme explores controllable sets in the previously introduced cooperative dual task space and flexibly controls them by exploiting the redundancy of the high degree-of-freedom (DOF) system. The planning and control framework is extensively validated in complex, cluttered, and nonstationary simulation scenarios where our framework is able to complete constrained tasks in a reliable manner, whereas existing solutions fail. We also perform additional real-world experiments with a two-armed 14 DOF torque-controlled KoBo robot. Our rigorous simulation studies and real-world experiments reinforce the claim that the framework is able to run robustly within the inner loop of modern collaborative robots with vision feedback.",Collision avoidance;dual-arm manipulation;motion and path planning;reactive and sensor-based planning
Planning agents in JAMES,"Testing is an obligatory step in developing multiagent systems. For testing multiagent systems in virtual, dynamic environments, simulation systems are required that support a modular, declarative construction of experimental frames, that facilitate the embedding of a variety of agent architectures and that allow an efficient parallel, distributed execution. We introduce the system JAMES (a Java based agent modeling environment for simulation). In JAMES, agents and their dynamic environment are modeled as reflective, time-triggered state automata. Its possibilities to compose experimental frames based on predefined components, to express temporal interdependencies, to capture the phenomenon of proactiveness and reflectivity of agents are illuminated by experiments with planning agents. The underlying planning system is a general-purpose system, about which no empirical results exist besides traditional static benchmark tests. We analyze the interplay between heuristics for selecting goals, viewing range, commitment strategies, explorativeness, and trust in the persistence of the world and uncover properties of the the agent, the planning engine, and the chosen test scenario: TILEWORLD.",
A multi-robot platform for mobile robots — A novel evaluation and development approach with multi-agent technology,"In the field of robotics, typical, single-robot systems encounter limits when executing complex tasks. Todays systems often lack flexibility and inter-operability, especially when interaction between participants is necessary. Nevertheless, well developed systems for robotics and for the cognitive and distributive domain are available. What is missing is the common link between these two domains. This work deals with the foundations and methods of a middle layer that joins a multi-agent system with a multi-robot system in a generic way. A prototype system consisting of a multiagent system, a multi-robot system and a middle layer will be presented and evaluated. Its purpose is to combine highlevel cognitive models and information distribution with robot-focused abilities, such as navigation and reactive behavior based artificial intelligence. This enables the assignment of various scenarios to a team of mobile robots.",mutli-agent system;mutli-robot system;mixed reality;distributed architectures;sensor fusion;intelligent systems;middle layer
AI-Enabled Network-Functions Virtualization and Software-Defined Architectures for Customized Statistical QoS Over 6G Massive MIMO Mobile Wireless Networks,"With the rapid deployments of the fifth generation (5G) mobile wireless networks, the shift from the 5G to the sixth generation (6G) mobile wireless networks has attracted tremendous research attention around the world. Featuring with the explosively increasing multimedia-traffics with very diverse services requirements, the 6G mobile wireless networks need to provide the customized services with heterogeneous types of quality of service (QoS) guarantees. However, how to efficiently support these customized services with heterogeneous QoS provisioning for 6G wireless networks has imposed many new challenges not encountered before. To conquer these difficulties, in this article we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled integration of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) techniques with network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined network (SDN) architectures to support the customized services over the 6G mobile wireless networks. Specifically, we develop the AI-enabled network architectural schemes which efficiently integrate three 6G-candidate techniques - massive-MIMO, NFV, and SDN - to significantly improve key performances of heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning in terms of effective capacity. We apply the massive MIMO transmission to substantially improve the channel throughput. Our NFV-based schemes abstract and slice the physical infrastructure and wireless resources in network data plane into several virtualized networks and obtain the optimal service delivery path with the maximum effective capacity among virtualized networks. Also, we develop a set of AI-enabled techniques including multiagent AI-plane architectures, edge-Al frameworks, and federated learning mechanisms for efficiently implementing our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated schemes. Collaborating with our developed platform and techniques, our multi-agent AI-plane based SDN controller coordinates the network nodes and resources allocations for each virtualized network. Our conducted extensive simulations validate and evaluate our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated architectures using AI-techniques, showing that they can efficiently support the customized statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning over 6G mobile wireless networks.",
Nowhere to Go: Benchmarking Multirobot Collaboration in Target Trapping Environment,"Collaboration is one of the most important factors in multirobot systems. Considering certain real-world applications and to further promote its development, we propose a new benchmark to evaluate multirobot collaboration in target trapping environment (T2E). In T2E, two kinds of robots (called captor robot and target robot) share the same space. The captors aim to catch the target collaboratively, while the target will try to escape from the trap. Both the trapping and escaping process can use the environment layout to help achieve the corresponding objective, which requires high collaboration between robots and the utilization of the environment. For the benchmark, we present and evaluate multiple learning-based baselines in T2E, and provide insights into regimes of multirobot collaboration. We also make our benchmark publicly available and encourage researchers from related robotics disciplines to propose, evaluate, and compare their solutions in this benchmark.",Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL);multirobot system;multirobot target trapping
MADRL-Based Joint Edge Caching and Bitrate Selection for Multicategory 360° Video Streaming,"360° video streaming has gained increasing attraction in the current popular virtual reality, AR, and MR applications, which can provide users with an immersive experience. In tile-based 360° video streaming, edge caching and bitrate selection strategies are jointly designed to improve users’ Quality of Experience (QoE), which incorporates video quality and rebuffer. However, the existing QoE-driven approaches use a unified QoE function to guide the decisions of edge caching and bitrate selection, which neglect the impact of video quality and rebuffer on different categories of 360° videos, thus failing to provide high-average QoE for users. In this article, we propose a multiagent deep-reinforcement-learning-based joint edge caching and bitrate selection strategy for multicategory 360° video streaming to improve users’ average QoE. The key idea is to employ different edge caching and bitrate selection strategies for different video categories to enable fine-grained performance optimization. Based on multicategory 360° video streaming, we first model a joint edge caching and bitrate selection problem as a multiagent cooperative Markov decision process with the goal of maximizing users’ average QoE. Next, an Field-of-View-aware multiagent soft actor–critic (FA-MASAC) algorithm is designed to help agents collaboratively learn optimal edge caching and bitrate selection decisions in a distributed way, in which each video category is treated as an agent. Finally, experimental results on real-world data sets show that our proposed strategy can greatly benefit users’ average QoE compared to existing strategies.",Bitrate selection;edge caching;multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL);multicategory 360° video streaming;Quality of Experience (QoE)
Toward Verifiable Real-Time Obstacle Motion Prediction for Dynamic Collision Avoidance,"Next generation Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) must reliably avoid moving obstacles. Existing dynamic collision avoidance methods are effective where obstacle trajectories are linear or known, but such restrictions are not accurate to many real-world UAV applications. We propose an efficient method of predicting an obstacle's motion based only on recent observations, via online training of an LSTM neural network. Given such predictions, we define a Nonlinear Probabilistic Velocity Obstacle (NPVO), which can be used select a velocity that is collision free with a given probability. We take a step towards formal verification of our approach, using statistical model checking to approximate the probability that our system will mispredict an obstacle's motion. Given such a probability, we prove upper bounds on the probability of collision in multiagent and reciprocal collision avoidance scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate in simulation that our method avoids collisions where state-of-the-art methods fail.",
A Multiagent Federated Reinforcement Learning Approach for Plug-In Electric Vehicle Fleet Charging Coordination in a Residential Community,"The increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy and electric vehicles (EV) in local microgrids/residential-community has brought a great challenge to balancing system stability and economic benefits. This paper proposes a decentralized framework based on an efficient federated deep reinforcement learning method for plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) fleet charging management in a residential community, which is equipped with a photovoltaic and battery energy storage system and connected to a local transformer. Firstly, the framework of PEV charging management is described as a virtual EV charging station coordinating charging tasks through sharing public information with distributed agents. Then, an individual preference model of PEV is developed considering heterogenous PEV charging anxiety, battery degradation, and collective penalty. Subsequently, we propose an attention-weighted federated soft-actor-critic method to efficiently seek the co-ordinational scheduling of the PEV fleet charging in a distributed way, where scalability and privacy protection can be ensured with attention-based information sharing. Finally, a real-world case study is conducted to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.",Plug-in electric vehicles;residential community;coordination strategy;federated deep reinforcement learning
Communication efficiency in multi-agent systems,"Despite the growing number of multi-agent software systems, relatively few physical systems have adopted multi-agent systems technology. Agents that interact with a dynamic physical environment have requirements not shared by virtual agents, including the need to transfer information about the world and their interaction with it. The agent communication languages proven successful in software based multi-agent systems incur overheads that make them impractical or infeasible for the transfer of low-level data. Instead, real world systems typically employ application specific protocols to transfer video, audio, sensory, or telemetry data. These protocols lack the transparency and portability of formal agent communication languages and consequently are limited in their scalability. We propose augmenting the capabilities of current multi-agent systems to provide for the efficient transfer of low-level information, by allowing backchannels of communication between agents with flexible protocols in a carefully principled way. We show that this extension can yield significant performance increases in communication efficiency and discuss the benefits of incorporating backchannels into a search a rescue robot system.",
A Hybrid ACO/PSO Control Algorithm for Distributed Swarm Robots,"In this paper, we present a hybrid ant colony optimization/particle swarm optimization (ACO/PSO) control algorithm for distributed swarm robots, where each robot can only communicate with its neighbors within its communication range. A virtual pheromone mechanism is proposed as the message passing coordination scheme among the robots. This hybrid ACO/PSO architecture adopts the feedback mechanism from environment of ACO and the adaptive interplay among agents of PSO to create a dynamic optimization system, and it is well-suited for a large scale distributed multi-agent system under dynamic environments. Furthermore, a pheromone-edge pair propagation funneling method is developed to reduce the communication overhead among robots. The simulation results concretely demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and individual simplicity of the proposed control architecture in a swarm robot system with real-world constraints",
Cooperative adaptive fuzzy tracking control for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems,"Here, we present a distributed adaptive control scheme for cooperative tracking of a class of nonlinear multiagent systems with partially unknown dynamics. The agents should reach an agreement on a time-varying reference trajectory as their virtual leader. The approach combines the artificial potential functions method with robust control terms to reach an appropriate controller for each agent. The unknown dynamics of each agent is approximated by an adaptive fuzzy system, with adaptive laws derived from Lyapunov stability analysis. Theoretical analysis reveals that Hœ performance criterion is satisfied and the effects of uncertainties are kept below a desired attenuation level. The proposed method is applied to the state tracking problem of five inverted pendulums. Results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling noise and bounded uncertainties as well as reaching consensus with high precision.",adaptive fuzzy control;cooperative tracking control;artificial potential function;multi-agent systems
Resource Allocation and QoE Maximization in Aerial MEC-empowered Metaverse Service: A CCM-Multi-agent DRL approach,"The integration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) with aerial platforms introduces novel potential for the Metaverse world by providing low-latency and highly reliable computing and communication services at the network edge. Nevertheless, this integration presents critical challenges, such as low Quality of Experience (QoE) due to the dynamic nature of aerial platforms, high resource demands, and the requirements for real-time data processing in the Metaverse environment. To address these challenges, we propose a Combinatorial Client-Master Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (CCM-MADRL) based joint resource allocation and QoE maximization framework to enable intelligent real-time decision-making in aerial MEC enabled Metaverse services. We form a collaborative ecosystem where agents are designed to represent both Metaverse service providers and aerial platforms to promote fairness and efficiency in resource allocation, as well as optimize service delivery. By incorporating CCM, our approach considers diverse metrics, such as latency, reliability, meta-distance, and energy efficiency, to ensure a holistic optimization of Metaverse services. The MADRL approach enables adaptive decision-making, allowing the system to respond to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of Metaverse applications. Results from simulations that mimic realistic Metaverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CCM-MADRL framework in terms of improved service performance, reduced latency, cost, and virtual meta-distance, maximized average QoE utility of Metaverse users, and enhanced resource utilization compared to baseline algorithms.",CCM-MADRL;meta-distance;Metaverse;Quality of experience;Resource allocation
VRRC: Empowering Metaverse-Infused Driving Experience for Multiplatoon Vehicles Through IoRT,"The emergence of metaverse applications and services heralds a new era of immersive driving experiences in future vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This unprecedented metaverse-infused driving experience, however, requires high-throughput transmissions for real-time high-quality 360° video streaming, which challenges today’s limited bandwidth resources provisioned by wireless communication infrastructure. To this end, this article introduces virtual road, real connection (VRRC), a novel framework for enhancing the metaverse-infused driving experience in VANET through the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). In the face of limited bandwidth resources, VRRC effectively addresses the challenge of high-throughput demand from two key perspectives. First, VRRC reduces redundant transmission by implementing a graph neural network (GNN)-based vehicle clustering method for dynamic multicast group formation, taking into account both the geographical status of vehicles and their communication patterns. Second, VRRC aggregates bandwidth resources across various channels by employing a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)–based multipath packet scheduling policy to adapt to heterogeneous channel conditions and dynamic vehicular mobility. Extensive experiments with real-world vehicular traces validate the effectiveness of VRRC and demonstrate its outperformance in reducing redundant traffic by 54% and improving overall throughput by 28%.
