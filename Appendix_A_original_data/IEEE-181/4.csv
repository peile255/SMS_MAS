Computer Science contributes to this by developing simulations of real world situations. An escape route can be regarded as a weighted graph where the labels associated with its edges are determined by the distance between two connected vertexes. Hence, given a starting vertex, it is possible to obtain the minimum path to one exit in the environment. Classical algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, can solve this problem. However, when the environment changes in real time, this class of algorithms is not efficient. Using Multi-agent Systems to solve this problem dynamically seems to be a good approach to plan escape routes in real time, given new information about the environment when modification are detected. This research exposes this approach, implementing a multi agent communication system in a 3D virtual environment.","","978-0-7695-4471-7","10.1109/BWSS.2010.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030013","Multi-agent Systems;Route Planning;Dijkstra's Algorithm;FIPA-OS;VRML","Solid modeling;Virtual environments;Real time systems;Humans;Three dimensional displays;Servers;Multiagent systems","","2","","12","IEEE","29 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The limited resources, like computing and storage, make conventional techniques to design Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) not particularly suitable for smart environments. This paper proposes a novel multiagent algorithm leveraging on devices activity footprints for intrusion detection in Internet of Things environment. Smart objects are mapped with real-valued vectors obtained through the IoT2Vec model, a word embedding technique able to capture the semantic context of device activities and represent these ones in dense vectors. The vectors are assigned to agents, which are spread onto a 2D virtual space, where they move following the rules of a bio-inspired model, the flocking model. A similarity function, applied to the associated vectors, drives the agents for a selective application of the movement rules. The outcome is the emergence of agent groups aggregated on the basis of the activities of their associated devices. Thus, it is possible to easily individuate isolated agents (i.e. devices with dissimilar activity from all), representing potential intruders or with anomalous behaviors to be monitored. Preliminary results confirm the validity of the approach.","","978-1-7281-8708-2","10.1109/AIKE48582.2020.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355441","Intrusion detection;Activity footprints;Multiagent systems;Smart Environments","Biological system modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Two dimensional displays;Semantics;Intrusion detection;Security;Smart devices","","4","","13","IEEE","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Masbiole employs a method of symbiotic learning and evolution where agents can learn or evolve according to their symbiotic relations toward others, i.e., considering the benefits/losses of both itself and an opponent. As a result, Masbiole can escape from Nash Equilibria and obtain better performances than conventional MAS where agents consider only their own benefits. This paper focuses on the evolutionary model of Masbiole, and its characteristics are examined especially with an emphasis on the behaviors of agents obtained by symbiotic evolution. In the simulations, two ideas suitable for the effective analysis of such behaviors are introduced; ""Match Type Tile-world (MTT)"" and ""Genetic Network Programming (GNP)"". MTT is a virtual model where tile-world is improved so that agents can behave considering their symbiotic relations. GNP is a newly developed evolutionary computation which has the directed graph type gene structure and enables to analyze the decision making mechanism of agents easily. Simulation results show that Masbiole can obtain various kinds of behaviors and better performances than conventional MAS in MTT by evolution.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.856720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580628","Evolutionary computation;multiagent systems;symbiosis;tile-world","Symbiosis;Evolution (biology);Multiagent systems;Ecosystems;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Economic indicators;Evolutionary computation;Decision making;Centralized control","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Evolution;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Symbiosis","157","","27","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, these systems can only react upon the presence of traffic jams and not to prevent the creation of unnecessary congestion. Anticipatory vehicle routing is promising in that respect, because this approach allows directing vehicle routing by accounting for traffic forecast information. This paper presents a decentralized approach for anticipatory vehicle routing that is particularly useful in large-scale dynamic environments. The approach is based on delegate multiagent systems, i.e., an environment-centric coordination mechanism that is, in part, inspired by ant behavior. Antlike agents explore the environment on behalf of vehicles and detect a congestion forecast, allowing vehicles to reroute. The approach is explained in depth and is evaluated by comparison with three alternative routing strategies. The experiments are done in simulation of a real-world traffic environment. The experiments indicate a considerable performance gain compared with the most advanced strategy under test, i.e., a traffic-message-channel-based routing strategy.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2011.2105867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730496","Autonomous agents;distributed control;intelligent vehicles;mobile agents;multiagent systems;navigation;software architecture;traffic control","Vehicles;Roads;Routing;Urban areas;Virtual environment;Driver circuits","","170","","29","IEEE","14 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By the first algorithm, the consensus is achieved for agent's models without unknown parameters under switching topologies.

The objective of this setup is twofold, on one hand it aims to be a useful educational tool for teaching robotics and on the other it is a tool to help in the development and study of embodied evolution. The design represents an intermediate system between a real and a simulated scenario so as to work with real robots and to make easier and simpler the configuration and modification of the rest of the elements of the experiments. The present operational setup consists, mainly, of a video projector to represent the virtual elements projecting them over the arena of the experiment, a zenithal camera to capture the state of real elements moving on the arena, and a computer which monitors and controls the scenario. As a result, both real and virtual elements interact on the arena and their state is updated based on world rules of the experiment and on the state and actions of other elements. The scheme implemented in the main computer to control and structure this environment is based on the one proposed in a previous work for the definition of scenarios in a simulation environment named Waspbed, which was designed for the study of simulated coevolution processes in multiagent systems. Apart from the advantages provided in robotics research when large testing period times are required, this setup is used for getting students from engineering degrees used to deal with robotics and all its associated fields, such as artificial vision, evolutionary robotics, communication protocols, etc. in a very simple, quick and cheap way, which otherwise wouldn't be feasible taking into account the academic constraints of time and resources.","1944-9410","978-1-61284-890-7","10.1109/VECIMS.2011.6053845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6053845","Learning environments;multirobots system;virtual environments;educational robotics;autonomous robotics;embodied evolution","Robot vision systems;Cameras;Computational modeling;Robot kinematics","","2","","15","IEEE","20 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inter- and intra-organizational relations need enterprise information systems (EIS) to support their establishment, deployment and discontinuation. This paper describes the model of multi-agent system (MAS) for supporting the dynamic enterprise model (DEM). It separates the business process from the organizational structure (organizational structure tier and business process tier), models each of them as MAS, and coordinates agents by ""yellow page"" mechanism. This model not only can regulate itself in terms of DEM, but also centers on the coordination strategies between the agents. It is believed that the model of MAS is a practical way to build flexible EIS.","","0-7803-5995-X","10.1109/WCICA.2000.862956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862956","","Object oriented modeling;Information systems;Management information systems;Multiagent systems;Virtual enterprises;Business process re-engineering;Laboratories;Electrical equipment industry;Industrial control;Industrial relations","","1","1","8","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We argue that an appropriate framework for building such software tools is that of an information economy, in which computational agents carry out the roles of information producer consumer and broker. We further argue that the emerging technology of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems provides the technological foundation upon which to implement such information economies, and provide the rich personalised information retrieval, management, and sharing services required to exploit the Internet. We illustrate our argument by describing, as a case study, the Zuno Digital Library (ZUNODL), a commercial framework for building commercial digital libraries.","","0-8186-7967-0","10.1109/ENABL.1997.630795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=630795","","Software libraries;World Wide Web;Software tools;Web and internet services;Appropriate technology;Information retrieval;Information management;Spine;Floors;Multiagent systems","","2","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the control input is integrated into the feedback system for parallel control, facilitating an augmented system’s optimal consensus control with an appropriate augmented performance index function to be established, which is identical to the original system’s suboptimal control with a conventional performance index. Second, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is evaluated based on the policy iteration algorithm, and the convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated. Then, an online learning algorithm becomes available to implement the ADP-based optimal parallel consensus control protocol without prior knowledge of the system. The Lyapunov approach is employed to indicate that the signals are convergent. Ultimately, the experimental data support the theoretical results.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2024.3403690","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0206100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073321,62273036); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, SAR(grant numbers:FDCT-22-009-MISE,0060/2021/A2,0015/2020/AMJ); State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety(grant numbers:RCS2021K005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10552313","Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP);coupled Hamilton-Jacobi;optimal consensus control;parallel control","Consensus control;Optimal control;Performance analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Multi-agent systems;Dynamic programming","","6","","50","IEEE","10 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
