With the increasing speed of computers and communication linlts, and the successful convergence of both fields, computers connected by high speed links now represent an enormously large distributed computing system. However, current information distributed system architectures are too rigid to cope with heterogeneity, inaccuracy and inflexibility of the real world requirements. In order to overcome such limitations, in this talk, we present Post Modem Distributed System based on Flexible Network using the concept of Flexible Computing proposed by the authors. We first give the outline of the Flexible Computing and the basic architecture of Flexible Network based on multi-agent systems. Then the characteristics of Modem Distributed Systems based on Flexible Network will be discussed. As application examples, we will show a virtual office and flexible video conference system.","","0-8186-8227-2","10.1109/ICPADS.1997.652616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=652616","","Distributed computing;Computer architecture;Modems;Computer networks;Convergence;Multiagent systems;Teleworking;Videoconference","","4","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such uncontrolled dispersion of vehicles can be avoided by evenly distributing vehicles along alternative routes. This paper proposes a practical multiagent-based approach, which is designed to achieve acceptable route allocation within a short time frame and with low communication overheads. In the proposed approach, which is called Congestion Avoidance and Route Allocation using Virtual Agent Negotiation (CARAVAN), vehicle agents (VAs) in the local vicinity communicate with each other before designated decision points (junctions) along their route. Cooperative route-allocation decisions are performed at these junctions. VAs use intervehicular communication to propagate key traffic information and undertake its distributed processing. Every VA exchanges its autonomously calculated route preference information to arrive at an initial allocation of routes. The allocation is improved using a number of successive virtual negotiation “deals.” The virtual nature of these deals requires no physical communication and, thereby, reduces communication requirements. In addition to the theory and concept, this paper presents the design and implementation methodology of CARAVAN, including experimental results for synthetic and real-world road networks. Results show that when compared against the shortest path algorithm for travel time improvements, CARAVAN offers 21%-43% gain (when traffic demand is below network capacity) and 13%-17% gain (when traffic demand exceeds network capacity), demonstrating its ability to regulate overall system traffic using local coordination strategies.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2013.2256420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6507596","Cooperative systems;dynamic traffic assignment;multiagent systems (MAS);traffic congestion management","Vehicles;Resource management;Roads;Indexes;Vehicle dynamics;Real-time systems;Software","","47","","26","IEEE","24 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We start with translating a WMN into a multi-agent system (MAS), where each node represents an agent of the MAS. The purpose is to benefit from the existing state-of-the-art verification techniques applicable in the multi-agent domain. We then prove the authentication property of the WMN.

Veit","Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York",2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm),"21 Mar 2016","2015","","","73","78","One key challenge in creating a sustainable society is to make consumer demand adaptive to the supply of electricity. We propose a generalization for the multiagent coordination algorithm for partially-centralized demand side management. In this setting, a central unit buys the electricity for the whole group, while the individual agents make their own demand decisions, based on their private constraints and preferences. While the state-of-the-art algorithm achieves strong guarantees, i.e., efficiency, strict budget balance as well as weak incentive compatibility, the formulation requires a simple supply model with a 2-step increasing threshold price function. In this paper, we propose MDSM, a generalized formulation of the multiagent coordination algorithm and prove that it converges to the optimal solution for all convex piecewise linear cost functions. Further, we perform simulations based on real world consumption data to evaluate the scalability of the algorithm in respect to the number of thresholds. The results indicate that the convergence time of MDSM is not sensitive to the number of thresholds in the cost function. This means, the proposed algorithm could be used for a broader set of distributed scheduling problems.","","978-1-4673-8289-2","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2015.7436279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436279","","Smart grids;Cost function;Convergence;Load management;Companies;Optimal scheduling;Conferences","","2","","14","IEEE","21 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to make them work without human involved and interaction, there is necessity of enabling them with intelligent, smart, or autonomic computing capabilities. Of course, intelligent function embedded is a straightforward approach. However, it may be difficult for the tiny devices to embed the intelligent computing capabilities due to their limited capacity and processing power. For a multiple intelligent agents system, it is not efficient to develop and maintain intelligent computing functions for each individual agent. Therefore, the idea is to design an intelligence entity sharing pool in which a requested intelligence entity can be dynamically composed from a number of atomic intelligence entities and complex intelligence entities residing in the intelligence entity pool and posted to virtual objects (v-object) in the v-object server for sharing by ubiquitous devices in the real world. This research is of three main phases: designing the intelligence entity sharing pool; mapping u-objects to virtual objects (v-objects); and developing a framework for intelligence entity sharing. This paper is mainly focused on describing the first two phases.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","10.1109/CSE.2009.326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284085","ubiquitous computing;intelligence entity;tree-structured knowledge representation;u-object;v-object","Competitive intelligence;Intelligent structures;Wireless sensor networks;Intelligent agent;Intelligent systems;Pervasive computing;Nanotechnology;Radiofrequency identification;Humans;Multiagent systems","","5","","21","IEEE","9 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Self-interested agents may find it rational to cheat others in the market. The authors have modeled federations of digital libraries selling information to one another. In the model, cooperation emerges through endogenous incentives. They had hypothesized that a number of factors would encourage cooperation: greater familiarity with trading partners, more memory for modeling others, fewer initially misbehaving agents, lower rates of strategy exploration, smaller world sizes, and more rapidly evolving measures of the likelihood of other agents to cooperate. The simulations confirmed many of the hypotheses. However the benefits of a small world size are dependent on memory size, and the usefulness of rapidly evolving estimates of cooperation is dependent on the types of strategies employed by the agents. They suggest that it will become increasingly important to allow agents conceptually to carve their networked environment into subcommunities where familiarity and trust can emerge, as opposed to promoting indiscriminate interactions within a large society of digital agents.","","0-8186-8500-X","10.1109/ICMAS.1998.699029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=699029","","Software libraries;Bandwidth;Artificial intelligence;Laboratories;Probes;Costs;Spirals;Multiagent systems","","10","1","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work addresses the issues with vector-field-based motion generation strategies, which are often prone to local-minima problems. We aim to bridge the gap between reactive solutions, global planning, and constrained cooperative (two-arm) manipulation in partially known surroundings. To this end, we introduce novel planning and real-time control strategies leveraging the geometry of the task space that are inherently coupled for seamless operation in dynamic scenarios. Our integrated multiagent global planning and control scheme explores controllable sets in the previously introduced cooperative dual task space and flexibly controls them by exploiting the redundancy of the high degree-of-freedom (DOF) system. The planning and control framework is extensively validated in complex, cluttered, and nonstationary simulation scenarios where our framework is able to complete constrained tasks in a reliable manner, whereas existing solutions fail. We also perform additional real-world experiments with a two-armed 14 DOF torque-controlled KoBo robot. Our rigorous simulation studies and real-world experiments reinforce the claim that the framework is able to run robustly within the inner loop of modern collaborative robots with vision feedback.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2023.3341689","State of Bavaria for the Geriatronics project; Region Hannover; Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Stiftung; KoBo34 by the BMBF(grant numbers:16SV7985); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10354340","Collision avoidance;dual-arm manipulation;motion and path planning;reactive and sensor-based planning","Task analysis;Robots;Planning;Robot kinematics;Collision avoidance;Jacobian matrices;Trajectory","","10","","90","IEEE","12 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For testing multiagent systems in virtual, dynamic environments, simulation systems are required that support a modular, declarative construction of experimental frames, that facilitate the embedding of a variety of agent architectures and that allow an efficient parallel, distributed execution. We introduce the system JAMES (a Java based agent modeling environment for simulation). In JAMES, agents and their dynamic environment are modeled as reflective, time-triggered state automata. Its possibilities to compose experimental frames based on predefined components, to express temporal interdependencies, to capture the phenomenon of proactiveness and reflectivity of agents are illuminated by experiments with planning agents. The underlying planning system is a general-purpose system, about which no empirical results exist besides traditional static benchmark tests. We analyze the interplay between heuristics for selecting goals, viewing range, commitment strategies, explorativeness, and trust in the persistence of the world and uncover properties of the the agent, the planning engine, and the chosen test scenario: TILEWORLD.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.910852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910852","","System testing;Multiagent systems;Strategic planning;Concrete;Benchmark testing;Computer science;Modular construction;Java;Automata;Engines","","26","","62","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Todays systems often lack flexibility and inter-operability, especially when interaction between participants is necessary. Nevertheless, well developed systems for robotics and for the cognitive and distributive domain are available. What is missing is the common link between these two domains. This work deals with the foundations and methods of a middle layer that joins a multi-agent system with a multi-robot system in a generic way. A prototype system consisting of a multiagent system, a multi-robot system and a middle layer will be presented and evaluated. Its purpose is to combine highlevel cognitive models and information distribution with robot-focused abilities, such as navigation and reactive behavior based artificial intelligence.

"AI-Enabled Network-Functions Virtualization and Software-Defined Architectures for Customized Statistical QoS Over 6G Massive MIMO Mobile Wireless Networks","X. Zhang; Q.

Featuring with the explosively increasing multimedia-traffics with very diverse services requirements, the 6G mobile wireless networks need to provide the customized services with heterogeneous types of quality of service (QoS) guarantees. However, how to efficiently support these customized services with heterogeneous QoS provisioning for 6G wireless networks has imposed many new challenges not encountered before. To conquer these difficulties, in this article we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled integration of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) techniques with network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined network (SDN) architectures to support the customized services over the 6G mobile wireless networks. Specifically, we develop the AI-enabled network architectural schemes which efficiently integrate three 6G-candidate techniques - massive-MIMO, NFV, and SDN - to significantly improve key performances of heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning in terms of effective capacity. We apply the massive MIMO transmission to substantially improve the channel throughput. Our NFV-based schemes abstract and slice the physical infrastructure and wireless resources in network data plane into several virtualized networks and obtain the optimal service delivery path with the maximum effective capacity among virtualized networks. Also, we develop a set of AI-enabled techniques including multiagent AI-plane architectures, edge-Al frameworks, and federated learning mechanisms for efficiently implementing our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated schemes. Collaborating with our developed platform and techniques, our multi-agent AI-plane based SDN controller coordinates the network nodes and resources allocations for each virtualized network. Our conducted extensive simulations validate and evaluate our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated architectures using AI-techniques, showing that they can efficiently support the customized statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning over 6G mobile wireless networks.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.005.2200408","U.S. Air Force(grant numbers:FA9453-15-C-0423); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10239348","","6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Wireless networks;Quality of service;Massive MIMO;Throughput;Network function virtualization;Artificial intelligence;Software defined networking","","8","","15","IEEE","5 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Considering certain real-world applications and to further promote its development, we propose a new benchmark to evaluate multirobot collaboration in target trapping environment (T2E). In T2E, two kinds of robots (called captor robot and target robot) share the same space. The captors aim to catch the target collaboratively, while the target will try to escape from the trap. Both the trapping and escaping process can use the environment layout to help achieve the corresponding objective, which requires high collaboration between robots and the utilization of the environment. For the benchmark, we present and evaluate multiple learning-based baselines in T2E, and provide insights into regimes of multirobot collaboration. We also make our benchmark publicly available and encourage researchers from related robotics disciplines to propose, evaluate, and compare their solutions in this benchmark.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2024.3366205","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61991411); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62103236); Project for Self-Developed Innovation Team of Jinan City(grant numbers:2021GXRC038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10454103","Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL);multirobot system;multirobot target trapping","Robots;Task analysis;Multi-robot systems;Collaboration;Benchmark testing;Force;Service robots","","2","","39","IEEE","29 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In tile-based 360° video streaming, edge caching and bitrate selection strategies are jointly designed to improve users’ Quality of Experience (QoE), which incorporates video quality and rebuffer. However, the existing QoE-driven approaches use a unified QoE function to guide the decisions of edge caching and bitrate selection, which neglect the impact of video quality and rebuffer on different categories of 360° videos, thus failing to provide high-average QoE for users. In this article, we propose a multiagent deep-reinforcement-learning-based joint edge caching and bitrate selection strategy for multicategory 360° video streaming to improve users’ average QoE. The key idea is to employ different edge caching and bitrate selection strategies for different video categories to enable fine-grained performance optimization. Based on multicategory 360° video streaming, we first model a joint edge caching and bitrate selection problem as a multiagent cooperative Markov decision process with the goal of maximizing users’ average QoE. Next, an Field-of-View-aware multiagent soft actor–critic (FA-MASAC) algorithm is designed to help agents collaboratively learn optimal edge caching and bitrate selection decisions in a distributed way, in which each video category is treated as an agent. Finally, experimental results on real-world data sets show that our proposed strategy can greatly benefit users’ average QoE compared to existing strategies.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3287187","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072330); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(grant numbers:20211093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155309","Bitrate selection;edge caching;multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL);multicategory 360° video streaming;Quality of Experience (QoE)","Streaming media;Bit rate;Quality of experience;Video recording;Quality assessment;Game theory;Bandwidth","","11","","42","IEEE","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing dynamic collision avoidance methods are effective where obstacle trajectories are linear or known, but such restrictions are not accurate to many real-world UAV applications. We propose an efficient method of predicting an obstacle's motion based only on recent observations, via online training of an LSTM neural network. Given such predictions, we define a Nonlinear Probabilistic Velocity Obstacle (NPVO), which can be used select a velocity that is collision free with a given probability. We take a step towards formal verification of our approach, using statistical model checking to approximate the probability that our system will mispredict an obstacle's motion. Given such a probability, we prove upper bounds on the probability of collision in multiagent and reciprocal collision avoidance scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate in simulation that our method avoids collisions where state-of-the-art methods fail.","2378-5861","978-1-5386-7926-5","10.23919/ACC.2019.8815387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8815387","","Prediction algorithms;Collision avoidance;Training;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty;Neural networks","","10","","19","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
