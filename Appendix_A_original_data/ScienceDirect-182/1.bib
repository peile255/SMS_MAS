The concept of "adaptive learning systems" assumes development and implementation of personalized learning platforms that adapt to students’ learning strategies, the sequence and difficulty of the task abilities, the time of feedback and students’ preferences. Metaverse technologies can implement adaptive personalized learning to a greater extent due to the possibilities of wider application of student-oriented technologies and provision of rational support for personal educational progress, taking into account individual characteristics.
Material and methods
The article describes the phenomenological toolkit of the metaverse based on the Microsoft solution to ensure adaptive learning of medical informatics, taking into account modern technologies.
Results
Two components of the implementation of adaptive learning with Medical Informatics are suggested: (1) creating responsive, professionally relevant learning content that spans simulated accurate digital models of the real world and augmented reality, (2) creation of a metaverse virtual environment for the organization of immersive adaptive learning based on a combination of personally oriented design and productive interaction. Our choice of the Microsoft solution assumes the possibility of implementing in the educational environment of the metaverse such educational tools as voice virtual assistants with artificial intelligence support (Microsoft Bot solution), Internet of things for education and generating educational data (Azure IoT, Power Platform), mirror worlds of educational destination (Microsoft Twins), augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (Microsoft Mesh, Microsoft HoloLens, Dynamics 365 Guides).
Conclusion
The proposed solutions of Microsoft make it possible to ensure high functionality in a number of issues when building a student-oriented virtual environment of the metaverse for adaptive and authentic learning.

In the digital era, the metaverse provides an immersive, interactive platform for tourism, allowing users to experience destinations virtually. Drawing from theoretical frameworks on tourism experience, the metaverse experience in this study is categorized into three core dimensions: presence and telepresence, immersion, interactivity and vividness. Additionally, social interaction, which encompasses peer-to-peer engagement and community building within virtual settings, is examined as a mediating factor that may enhance the overall tourism experience. Data was collected from 400 tourists in Thailand and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test two primary hypotheses: first, that the metaverse has a direct positive influence on tourism experience, and second, that social interaction mediates this relationship. Results support both hypotheses, demonstrating that the metaverse significantly enhances tourism experience through its immersive and interactive features, with social interaction further amplifying this effect as a partial mediator. These findings suggest valuable implications for tourism practitioners and developers of virtual tourism platforms, emphasizing the need to integrate high-quality, socially engaging digital experiences. The study contributes to understanding how metaverse technology, combined with social engagement, can enrich virtual tourism and align with Thailand’s broader digital tourism initiatives.}

In this context, the metaverse promises a transformative confluence of the physical and digital realms, offering unparalleled avenues for human augmentation in industrial applications. Yet, while several conceptual metaverse architectures and illustrative case studies have emerged, they scarcely delve deep into the nuanced practice of cultivating the industrial metaverse for factory-scale applications. Addressing this research gap, this work introduces a novel architecture for a data-centric and semantic-enhanced industrial metaverse. The architecture intricately weaves the physical factory domain with the metaverse, fortified by a suite of ten modules, facilitating data flow and knowledge synchronization with the integration of digital twins and semantic models. The practical application and relevance of this architecture are further accentuated through a case study focused on in-plant material flow tracking. Emerging results underline that our architecture encapsulates the essential components for constructing a factory-scale industrial metaverse. Future research will be geared towards a comprehensive validation of the proposed metaverse architecture, culminating in tangible implementations across diverse industrial contexts.}

In September 2020, the European Commission adopted the Digital Finance Package, that includes a digital finance strategy, legislative proposals on crypto-assets and digital resilience, as well as a renewed strategy for retail payments. This work proposes the framework for a new pan-European retail payment system based on public identity recognition and disintermediation of currently used devices: Euro-PaID. The aim is to have a competitive EU financial sector that gives consumers access to innovative financial products whilst ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. The new system is designed in compliance with existing regulations. However, because certain aspects do not fall within the scope of applicable EU law, ad hoc regulation should be enacted. We concluded that a holistic approach is essential in rethinking regulation to address the numerous social implications of a hypothetical change in the payments system.}

In this regard, this review aims to offer a state-of-the-art overview of gamification in business, revealing its current trends and future directions. Using business research on gamification published in the last decade (2012–2022) found on Scopus and Web of Science, we conduct a performance analysis to illuminate the field's performance (publication productivity and impact) alongside its key contributors (journals, authors, and countries) as well as a science mapping using a co-citation analysis to locate knowledge foundations, and bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence analysis to reveal major themes in business gamification. Our exploration has unearthed gamification's pervasive influence across business domains, from enhancing learning and fostering innovation to empowering marketing strategies and catalyzing transformation. Gamification has also made significant inroads into management practices, driving engagement, influencing behavioral outcomes, and ushering sustainability. Peering into the future, our density-centrality quadrant analysis casts light on emerging frontiers. Noteworthily, we expect the next wave of gamification to be shaped by the allure of video games and the metaverse, bespoke industry-specific designs, confluence with e-commerce trends, emphasis on sustainable development, expanded social responsibilities, innovations in virtual reality, intersections with human urbanism, and the rise of smart cities. As gamification continues to integrate and reshape myriad facets of the business world, it holds the promise of not only enriching current practices but also charting the course for the future of innovative, sustainable, and transformative business strategies.}

abstract = {Owing to the major development of social media platforms, the usage of technological adaptation increases by means of editing software tools. Posting media in social communication environments has become one of our common daily routines. Before posting, various editing generators are used to manipulate pixel values, such as for enhancing brightness and contrast. Undoubtedly, this software helps bring posting media from ordinary to outstanding. But such a type of editing crosses the line in terms of creating fakes—anything that comes from anywhere and does not retain its originality anyway. It poses a series of issues in the process of multimedia forensics investigation and chain of custody. In order to restrict the attempts at deep faking and make the investigation hierarchy more effective, efficient, and reliable in the socio-cyber space (SCS), this paper presents a novel framework called DF-SCW. A digital forensics-enabled socio-cyber world with artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep neural networks (DNNs), for detecting and analyzing deep fake media investigations on social media platforms. It compares pixels with their neighboring values in the same media (such as images and videos) to identify information about the original one. There is a media flag designed to filter out malicious and dangerous attempts, like a powerful leader declaring war. Putting flags on such fakes helps digital investigators resist sharing the posts. In addition, the other prospect of this research is to make the digital forensics ecosystem more appropriate to take qualitative judgments in real-time while media is uploaded on social media platforms. The simulation of the proposed DF-SCW is tested on three different platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Through the experiment, the DF-SCW outperformed in terms of detection, identification, and analysis of deepfake media by an increased rate of 3.77%.}

Metaverse Identity is conceptualized as a user’s digital self, encompassing personal attributes, data footprints, social roles, and economic elements. To elucidate its core characteristics and implications, this framework introduces two guiding principles: Equivalence and Alignment and Fusion and Expansiveness. The first principle advocates for consistency between metaverse and real-world identities in behavioral norms and social standards, ensuring rights protection and establishing conduct guidelines. The second emphasizes the deep integration and transformative evolution of metaverse identities, enabling them to transcend real-world constraints, meet diverse needs, and foster inclusivity. Together, two principles serve as complementary pillars, balancing ethical integration with dynamic co-evolution. Building on this foundation, the study identifies five critical challenges: interoperability, legal boundaries, privacy and identity management, risks from deepfakes and synthetic identities, and identity fragmentation impacting psychological well-being. To address these challenges, strategic recommendations are offered to guide stakeholders. By constructing this framework, the study fills a key theoretical gap, advances systematic research, and provides a foundation for policies and governance strategies to address the complexities of metaverse identities in a rapidly evolving digital domain.}

abstract = {Background
The redirected walking (RDW) method for multi-user collaboration requires maintaining the relative position between users in a virtual environment (VE) and physical environment (PE). A chasing game in a VE is a typical virtual reality game that entails multi-user collaboration. When a user approaches and interacts with a target user in the VE, the user is expected to approach and interact with the target user in the corresponding PE as well. Existing methods of multi-user RDW mainly focus on obstacle avoidance, which does not account for the relative positional relationship between the users in both VE and PE.
Methods
To enhance the user experience and facilitate potential interaction, this paper presents a novel dynamic alignment algorithm for multi-user collaborative redirected walking (DA-RDW) in a shared PE where the target user and other users are moving. This algorithm adopts improved artificial potential fields, where the repulsive force is a function of the relative position and velocity of the user with respect to dynamic obstacles. For the best alignment, this algorithm sets the alignment-guidance force in several cases and then converts it into a constrained optimization problem to obtain the optimal direction. Moreover, this algorithm introduces a potential interaction object selection strategy for a dynamically uncertain environment to speed up the subsequent alignment. To balance obstacle avoidance and alignment, this algorithm uses the dynamic weightings of the virtual and physical distances between users and the target to determine the resultant force vector.
Results
The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated using a series of simulations and live-user experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our novel dynamic alignment method for multi-user collaborative redirected walking can reduce the distance error in both VE and PE to improve alignment with fewer collisions.}

We first analyzed the educational needs for cinematography lighting education by conducting interviews with six cinematography professionals from academia and industry. Accordingly, we presented Art Mirror, a VR soundstage for teachers and students to emulate cinematography lighting in virtual scenarios. We evaluated Art Mirror from the aspects of usability, realism, presence, sense of agency, and collaboration. Sixteen participants were invited to take a cinematography lighting course and assess the design elements of Art Mirror.

Employing co-citation and text-mining techniques to investigate 281 articles, we identified five knowledge fields that map the intellectual structure of this domain: brand equity, industrial branding, brand value, global brand leadership, and relationship marketing. We also gained a deeper understanding of the important topics in global B2B branding literature. This framework not only highlights gaps and challenges in conceptual and methodological approaches but also challenges and extends existing academic discourse. It offers a systematic approach to strategic decision-making and the overhaul of marketing practices, guiding practitioners to navigate the complexities of global B2B branding. Our critical analysis sets a new agenda for future research, calling for a more rigorous and holistic advancement in the field of global B2B branding.}

Data-driven Agent-based Modeling and Simulation (DDABMS) equips MASs with access to decisions based on near-real-time data, allowing for more informed decisions for systems’ enhancements. Digital Twins (DTs) can further enhance MASs by serving as virtual replicas that enable what-if scenarios exploration and allow continuous validation and refinement of the underlying models with real-time data from MASs. However, we discovered a gap in systematically integrating DTs with DDABMS, as existing efforts focus on specific problems and domains rather than providing a generalized framework to develop DTs with DDABMS. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a generalized framework to develop DTs for MASs with DDABMS. To demonstrate the practicability of our proposed framework for modeling and simulation of complex systems, we present an illustrative case study based on an epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model.}

Particularly, the advancement of technologies has further given birth to a novel form of social platform as blockchain-enabled social media (i.e., SocialFi), which is growing both in size and number of users. Accordingly, the rapid development of these blockchain-enabled social media firms illustrates the requirement to better understand the reasons behind this increase and the innovative practices and strategies of firms in this emerging field. Using the case of Pixie – the world’s first fully functional decentralised photo and video sharing social network based on blockchain technology, this insight paper identifies a conceptual model of blockchain-enabled social media that is useful for illustrating the successful business strategy and operations of firms. Particularly, the identified model employs four pillars of innovation as fundamental technologies, governance and operations, incentive mechanism design, and organisational structure and performance. Based on this crypto economy social media model, the study further presents the main challenges, discusses the implications based on agency theory, as well as highlights several directions for future research associated with blockchain-enabled social media.}

Model-based planning and control can address the particularities of deformable object manipulation; however, their competence is heavily dependent on the models’ accuracy and reconstruction frequencies. Despite the many breakthroughs that have been achieved in real-time modelling and behavior prediction of deformable objects, the calibration of such models and the measurement of their accuracy remain a significant challenge. In this paper, a method for the definition of the physics parameters of flexible material reconstruction models is presented. The proposed systematic approach, employing a number of optimization algorithms, fine-tunes the model’s parameters for the real-world deformable object, as captured by the perception system, to be aligned with its digital twin. A mass-spring model for the reconstruction of two-dimensional fabric objects is used as an application paradigm. An experimental setup in an industrially relevant environment validates the applicability of the proposed approach and is used for assessing alternative sensing practices and optimization algorithms.}

abstract = {The introduction of the Metaverse and the rise of social virtual reality platforms such as VRChat has led to increased communication and collaboration in virtual reality. As interactions in social virtual reality take place through avatars, the behaviour, and in particular the eye gaze of an avatar can have an impact on the user experience. However, it is still unclear which features of the user experience are most influenced. Therefore, this study used data from 44 female participants to investigate how avatar gaze behaviour (static eyes vs. real-time tracked eyes) affects their perceived quality of communication and the amount of one-sided eye contact participants make during a communicative or collaborative task in virtual reality. In addition, the study investigated the mediating role of perceived avatar “uncanniness” (i.e., the finding that humanoid objects that imperfectly resemble real people evoke feelings of discomfort) in this relationship and the moderation effect of two multi-user scenarios (collaboration vs. communication). The results showed that uncanniness directly affected the perceived quality of communication. However, it did not significantly mediate the relationship between avatar eye gaze behaviour and the quality of communication or the amount of one-sided eye contact. Finally, there were no significant differences in user experience between the two scenarios. From this, we can conclude that the uncanniness of an avatar being interacted with in VR is not enough to hinder communication and collaboration in an immersive medium. And even if an avatar is perceived as uncanny, normative communication cues such as eye contact are still present. Notably, due to sample availability, the results of this study are based on a female-only sample. Thus, future research can benefit from exploring the outlined effects in a more gender-balanced sample.}

Nevertheless, cities must face the challenge of adapting to technology advances arising from the digital era we are living in. Under this context, urban digital twins (UDTs) have recently superseded smart cities in the attempt of improving the management of city resources and the live of citizens through the use of sophisticated technology. Although the governance of smart cities has been broadly handled in the literature, the influence of UDTs on urban governance still remains unaddressed. This article aims at closing this gap by developing a framework to assess the contribution of UDTs in the governance of cities. A mixed methodology combining an in-depth literature review, a four-round Delphi technique and the Best-Worst multi-criteria decision making method was implemented to this end. The new instrument consists of a two-tier scheme comprising 7 categories and 33 attributes, of which 26 were deemed as essential for an efficient governance. Institutional dimension prevailed over the remaining sustainability domains. Three performance thresholds were defined: low governance, average governance and high governance. The application of the rating system to the UDT of Singapore as case study determined a high level of governance for this city. Some policies were however recommended to strengthen gaps found in Singapore.}

Sensitivity analysis and comprehensive evaluation yield powerful insights into the robustness and adaptability of solutions. With these findings at their disposal, policymakers will be more equipped to take on unpredictability and take advantage of opportunities for sustainable urban mobility.

The new Forearm Dual Triboelectric Sensor (FDTS) intends to demonstrate triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as an affordable and flexible alternative to expensive and bulky EMG devices used in prosthetic limbs by amputated patients. The proposed concept can successfully recognize up to 10 different input signals from the bending or tapping of the middle and little fingers and hand opening-closing action used as input commands for a Human-Computer-Interface (HCI) for computer navigation. In the experiments, we can successfully control horizontal, vertical and diagonal movements, left and right click of the cursor on the screen, and scroll up/down options. The FDTS was also implemented in robotic hand remote control, where different index and small finger bending amplitudes were translated to different mechanical finger rotation degrees and overall robot hand movement. Additionally, the robotic hand was able to perform right and left clicks controlled by fast finger bending. More experiments demonstrate the FDTS response to other wrist movements, such as pronation and supination. This proves the potential benefits of TS in cost-effective prosthetic devices, with limited but better functionality than standard body-powered prostheses. In the future, FDTS-like devices can be modularly integrated with artificial limbs to allow amputated patients to control computers and external devices. Additionally, this solution can positively impact the integration of online spaces like the Metaverse with healthcare technologies for rehabilitation and social inclusion.}

Contributions include a virtual anatomy lab for neuroanatomy education and collaborative sessions on spatial morphology correlation and neuroenergetic absorption models. Evaluations show that the SAM2 adapter preserves fine cellular details and manages irregular boundaries. Preliminary sessions indicate potential to enhance neuroscience education, improve remote collaboration among scientists, and provide access to advanced neuroscientific data and tools.

Since various companies are transporting goods all over the world to evaluate the sustainability, speed, and resiliency of freight transportation systems, data and freight fluidity measurement systems are needed. In this study, an integrated decision-making model is proposed to advantage prioritize the freight fluidity measurement alternatives. The proposed model is composed of two main stages. In the first stage, the Dombi norms based Logarithmic Methodology of Additive Weights (LMAW) is used to find the weights of criteria. In the second phase, an extended Evaluation based on the Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method with Dombi unction for aggregation is presented to determine the final ranking results of alternatives. Three freight fluidity measurement alternatives are proposed, namely doing nothing, integrating freight activities into Metaverse for measuring fluidity, and forming global governance of freight activities for measuring fluidity through available data. Thirteen criteria, which are grouped under four main aspects namely technology, governance, efficiency, and environmental sustainability, and a case study at which a ground framework is formed for the experts to evaluate the alternatives considering the criteria are used in the multi-criteria decision-making process. The results of the study indicate that integrating freight activities into Metaverse for measuring fluidity is the most advantageous alternative, whereas doing nothing is the least advantageous one.}

The complexity and heterogeneity of smart cities have become vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks, especially privacy-related attacks such as inference and data poisoning ones. Federated Learning (FL) has been regarded as a hopeful method to enable distributed learning with privacy-preserved intelligence in IoT applications. Even though the significance of developing privacy-preserving FL has drawn as a great research interest, the current research only concentrates on FL with independent identically distributed (i.i.d) data and few studies have addressed the non-i. i.d setting. FL is known to be vulnerable to Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) attacks, where an adversary can presume to act as a contributor participating in the training process to acquire the private data of other contributors. This paper proposes an innovative Privacy Protection-based Federated Deep Learning (PP-FDL) framework, which accomplishes data protection against privacy-related GAN attacks, along with high classification rates from non-i. i.d data. PP-FDL is designed to enable fog nodes to cooperate to train the FDL model in a way that ensures contributors have no access to the data of each other, where class probabilities are protected utilizing a private identifier generated for each class. The PP-FDL framework is evaluated for image classification using simple convolutional networks which are trained using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The empirical results have revealed that PF-DFL can achieve data protection and the framework outperforms the other three state-of-the-art models with 3%–8% as accuracy improvements.}

The adoption of immersive learning is accelerating as an innovative approach for science and engineering subjects. With new powerful interaction techniques in XR and the latest developments in artificial intelligence, interactive and self-directed learning are becoming important. However, there is a lack of research exploring these emerging technologies research with kinesthetic learning or “hands-one learning" as a pedagogical approach using real-time hand interaction and agent-guided learning in immersive environments. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses machine learning agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in science and engineering education through real-time hand interaction in the virtual world. To implement the following approach, this paper uses a chemistry-related case study and presents a usability evaluation conducted with 15 expert reviewers and 2 subject experts. NASA task load index is used for cognitive workload measurement, and the technology acceptance model is used for measuring perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in the evaluations. The evaluation with expert reviewers proposed self-directed learning using trained agents can help in the end-user training in learning technical topics and controller-free hand interaction for kinesthetic tasks can improve hands-on learning motivation in virtual laboratories. This success points to a novel research area where agents embodied in an immersive environment using machine learning techniques can forge a new pedagogical approach where they can act as both teacher and assessor.}

The current research created a science fiction prototype, based on expert opinion expressed during an imagination workshop, which the authors then presented to a sample of people with ambulatory disabilities. Through a conjoint analysis, the sample members delineated the elements of the prototype they regarded as most important. The participants considered personal mobility assistive technology (either an automated wheelchair or an exoskeleton) the most important, followed by personal automation (autonomous [driverless] vehicle or personal robot) and thirdly by personal assistance technologies (real-time response versus augmented metaverse planning systems). Outputs to the conjoint analysis were clustered and three categories of individual emerged (i) more innovatively minded people who occupied the first cluster and preferred an exoskeleton, a personal robot and a subscription to the metaverse, (ii) people who appeared to be less technologically inclined and preferred an automated wheelchair, an autonomous vehicle and a subscription to a real-time assistive system, and (iii) a group with members favouring an AV but with few other predilections.}

By tackling challenges such as data scarcity, missing information, and biased distributions, the proposed model effectively captures the dynamic interactions between topics and sentiments within complex datasets. The method combines the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for detecting topic-related patterns with a revised Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to trace the emotional flow within contexts, leveraging the strengths of sequential data processing. These components are integrated within a Bayesian probability framework, modeling the conditional probabilities of sentences expressing specific sentiments and documents being associated with particular topics. The combined feature and state vectors from the CNN and revised RNN within this Bayesian setup enable precise classification and prediction of topics and sentiments. Furthermore, this paper explores innovative research avenues, including sentiment analysis in 3D virtual reality environments and the development of new algorithms that reflect content creation techniques in the metaverse, offering dynamic system construction. This integrated approach not only enhances data-driven decision-making but also unlocks new possibilities for advanced multi-text analysis.}

One of these is the idea that quantitative analysis is a feature of the present and the future, and qualitative analysis of the past. The paper addresses this fallacy. Our discussion of the main schools of thought in urban morphology and their influential researchers suggests that quantitative approaches are well rooted in it since at least the mid-twentieth century and that the dominance of quantitative or qualitative tools is subject to cycles, as it happens in other sciences. Demonstration of both statements leads to a focus on a line of approaches, historico-geographical, configurational, and lately morphometrics, which share a common interest in cross-cases regularities, hence practices of pattern recognition.}

The system effectively solves the limitations of traditional guidance systems in complex environments and improves navigation efficiency and user experience. In terms of path planning efficiency, the average path planning time of the intelligent guidance system is shorter than that of the traditional system; in terms of path navigation accuracy, the average accuracy of the intelligent guidance system reaches 99.1%, which is much higher than the 95.2% of the traditional system.

In this burgeoning metaverse, a paradigm shift is seen in how people engage, collaborate, and become immersed in digital environments. An especially intriguing concept taking root within this metaverse landscape is that of digital twins. Initially rooted in industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts, digital twins are now making their mark in the metaverse, presenting opportunities to elevate user experiences, introduce novel dimensions of interaction, and seamlessly bridge the divide between the virtual and physical realms. Digital twins, conceived initially to replicate physical entities in real-time, have transcended their industrial origins in this new metaverse context. They no longer solely replicate physical objects but extend their domain to encompass digital entities, avatars, virtual environments, and users. Despite the vital contributions of digital twins in the metaverse, there has been no research that has explored the applications and scope of digital twins in the metaverse comprehensively. However, there are a few papers focusing on some particular applications. Addressing this research gap, we present an in-depth review of the pivotal role of application digital twins in the metaverse. We present 15 digital twin applications in the metaverse, ranging from simulation and training to emergency preparedness. This study outlines the critical limitations of integrating digital twins and metaverse and several future research directions.}

This transformation is based on the connection between the physical environment and the virtual digital systems. However, Digital Twins (DTs) can represent this connection, and despite its importance, currently DTs are hindered by several challenges related to the accuracy of data, long workflows and fragmented digital ecosystems. To this end, this study proposes an innovative approach, “Enhanced Digital Twin (EDT)”, to overcome the traditional DTs’ limitations. To achieve this, a scientometric review is conducted based on quantitative mixed methods using VOSviewer and RStudio to analyse the collected database from Scopus of 342 peer-reviewed journal articles from 2020 to 2024. This was further supported through the analysis of similar applied case studies of relevant literature based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Findings represent that EDT can offer advantages through three main categories: construction, building and human aspects. The article also outlines future research directions and highlights some key benefits and challenges. Also, this article contributes originally to the existing body of knowledge by bridging the gap between digital technology and sustainable practices through proposing a holistic framework for SDGs-based EDT in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The latter supports the implementation of the EDT, reaching the SDGs, and the engagement of stakeholders in all phases of the building life cycle.}

As industries within supply chains become more interlinked, the need for seamless integration across these digital environments becomes critical. This paper addresses the challenge of interconnecting private industrial metaverses by proposing a novel data fabric framework that supports diverse modalities, ensures privacy, and adheres to business agreements. We highlight the role of the distributed compute continuum in the framework and demonstrate its practical utility through deployments in Unity and Omniverse across various geographic locations, highlighting the need for AI-based interconnection to optimize real-time analytics and operational scalability. Our experiment shows that even transmitting a 3D patch file, which is considerably smaller than the original base file, across metaverses in different geographic locations requires substantial computational and communication resources, potentially limiting real-time collaboration between metaverses. This observation highlights the importance of AI-based interconnection in enabling a textual metaverse, where instead of transmitting 3D patch objects over the web, only a fine-grained textual description of the patch file is shared. This method allows for more efficient transmission using current networking technology. The textual metaverse is expected to employ an AI-based encoder at the source and an AI-based decoder at the destination to convert the 3D patch into text and subsequently reconstruct it back into the 3D patch.}

Fortunately, we found that this kind of stochastic scheduling problem combined with sharing has an invariant optimal substructure that is independent of the number of layers, and propose the Placement of Resource in Any layer Edge architecture (PRAE) algorithm. We find an efficient way to solve it by splitting it into multiple subproblem groups and characterizing the relationship between these subproblems as an isomorphic network. We then identify optimal conditions for subproblem groups at different layers, and quickly achieve a solution using dynamic programming. Extensive evaluations show that PRAE improves resource utilization by over 28% compared to average demand models and achieves over 98% of optimal performance across diverse scenarios, with significantly lower computational complexity.}

Cyber defense is reactive and slow. On average, the time-to-remedy is hundreds of times larger than the time-to-compromise. In response, Human Digital Twins (HDTs) offer the capability of running massive simulations across multiple domains on the Metaverse. Simulated results may predict adversaries' behaviors and tactics, leading to more proactive cyber defense strategies. However, current HDTs’ cognitive architectures are underdeveloped for such use.
Objective
This paper aims to make a case for extending the current digital cognitive architectures as the first step toward more robust HDTs that are suitable for realistic Metaverse cybersecurity simulations.
Methods
This study formally documented 108 psychology constructs and thousands of related paths based on 20 time-tested psychology theories, all of which were packaged as Cybonto—a novel ontology. Then, this study applied 20 network science centrality algorithms in ranking the Cybonto psychology constructs by their influences.
Results
Out of 108 psychology constructs, the top 10 are Behavior, Arousal, Goals, Perception, Self-efficacy, Circumstances, Evaluating, Behavior-Controllability, Knowledge, and Intentional Modality. In this list, only Behaviors, Goals, Perception, Evaluating, and Knowledge are parts of existing digital cognitive architectures. Notably, some of the constructs are not explicitly implemented. Early usability tests demonstrate that Cybonto can also be useful for immediate uses such as manual analysis of hackers’ behaviors and automatic analysis of behavioral cybersecurity knowledge texts.
Conclusions
The results call for specific extensions of current digital cognitive architectures such as explicitly implementing more refined structures of Long-term Memory and Perception, placing a stronger focus on noncognitive yet influential constructs such as Arousal, and creating new capabilities for simulating, reasoning about, and selecting circumstances.}

This paper introduces a novel framework capable of concurrently facilitating fungible token exchange, as well as the processing of both individual and batch non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We deploy token bridges that meet different token standards to support cross-chain staking and unlocking of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155. To minimize both waiting times and handling fees, we relocate processes necessitating frequent transactions and verifications to the sidechain. Additionally, we adopt a batch-processing approach for tokens necessitating cross-chain transfers, leveraging payment channels to facilitate efficiency. The system’s reliability is upheld through the validator group. Validators acquire an initial reputation value by making deposits and enhance both their rewards and reputation by successfully completing NFT auction tasks on the sidechain. We use OpenZeppelin’s security library functions to standardize token operations, and carefully design the validator’s reward, punishment, and reputation mechanisms. Our comprehensive contract security audit and system analysis validate our solution’s effectiveness in mitigating common vulnerabilities and internal threats. Implementation and testing with Ethereum and its test network demonstrate substantial reductions in transmission time for key cross-chain token steps by nearly half. Moreover, our framework showcases efficiency and cost-effectiveness with an average gas cost of 693,379.}

It identified five frames: economic prospect frame, unwanted future frame, consumer prospect frame, threatening future frame, and probable future frame. Overall, findings suggest a polarized framing of the metaverse on social media. While the majority of voices about the metaverse are optimistic, there is also a strong negative and dystopian perspective in more than one third of the SNS news. This positive or negative one-sided framing of the metaverse on SNSs may therefore fragmentize and polarize the audience, rather than informing in a balanced way.

Employing a mixed-methods approach, we began with a qualitative phase consisting of 68 interviews (18 healthcare employees, 37 users of Wearable Health Devices, 7 AI developers, and 6 academics). Grounded in the theories of constructed emotion and the uncanny valley, as well as insights from the qualitative phase, we developed a robust model investigating the role of AI sensation on costumer emotional responses and engagement. This was followed by a survey of 557 healthcare employees. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS for descriptive statistics and reliability assessments, and AMOS for confirmatory factor analysis to validate the robustness of our measurement models. our findings show that AI sensation can drive customer subjective feeling state and AI affects. We also found empirical evidence that both can mediate the relationship between AI sensation, customer subjective feeling state, AI affects and activation engagement. Our findings can offer valuable understanding for managers and AI developers, underscoring the important role of AI sensation for driving engagement.}

However, it is unclear where, what, and when the implementation of AI stremer is more effective than human beings in live-streaming e-commerce. To explore the dynamic interrelationships and temporal evolution between AI and human streamers and viewer engagement, this study examined the evolving role of AI streamers in live-streaming e-commerce. We utilised the linear mixed model (LMM) and the time-varying effect model (TVEM) to examine whether AI and human streamers differ in both monetary and non-monetary engagement activities. Additionally, we investigated how these differences change over time and whether such changes are consistent across different consumption contexts. The dataset consists of 924,036 products from 21,190 live streaming shows in 123 live broadcasting rooms over a period of four months was used in this study. The results suggest that AI streamers can substitute for humans in monetary activities in the context of utilitarian consumption but not in hedonic consumption. However, the substitute effect of AI may gradually diminish over time. In addition, in a hedonic context, AI exhibits an increasing effect on viewer engagement over time.}

With the aim of providing an historical overview, this study examines the role of metaverse in business model innovation, unveiling the elements introduced by this emerging technology that can affect companies' business models, the changes that metaverse generates over time in value creation and value capture actions, and the sectors most involved in this transformation. A systematic literature review with a double layer of analysis was conducted (bibliometric and content analysis). Our results reveal that over time, metaverse generated three waves of impacts on companies' business models. For each wave, the actions of value creation and capture enabled by metaverse were identified and the sectors involved in this transformation over time were summarized. Results were discussed in order to debate the capability of metaverse to generate new actions of value creation according to radical, incremental, and exaptation paths of innovation and the consequent capability to capture value among several stakeholders. Salient research gaps emerged and future research directions were proposed.}

Using a sample size of 567 respondents, the data analysis method employed in this study is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results reveal the driving factors affecting consumer adoption intention in metaverse commerce. The study identifies perceived technological, regulatory, and cyber risks as significant barriers to consumer adoption intention in metaverse commerce. Conversely, the findings highlight the importance of performance and effort expectancy, perceived herd behaviour, hedonic motivation, and consumer innovativeness as key enablers driving consumer adoption intention in metaverse commerce. Interestingly, subjective norms were found to have an insignificant effect in this context. This research contributes to understanding consumer behaviour in the emerging field of metaverse commerce and provides valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers. The identified barriers and enablers can guide strategic decision-making, allowing businesses to address consumer concerns and capitalize on the factors that drive adoption intention in this novel environment. Future research avenues could explore additional factors and delve deeper into the dynamics of consumer behaviour within the metaverse.}

The study, built on the attachment theory and socio-technological approach, empirically evaluated affective and cognitive responses from 278 metaverse platform users using structural equation modelling. The results show that the technology factors, namely synchronicity, vicarious expression, and security and privacy, impacted platform attachment. The social factor, deepfakes interaction, impacted emotional attachment to deepfakes. The other social factors, deepfakes' familiarity and reputation, did not affect emotional attachment to Deepfakes' content.

Current methods often struggle to handle sensor and actuator disruptions from Byzantine agents and suffer from excessive controller updates, which lead to communication overhead and the potential for Zeno behavior. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Hybrid Dynamic Event-Triggered Mechanism (HDETM), designed to minimize unnecessary agent interaction and reduce the frequency of controller updates while maintaining system robustness. By employing regularization techniques that ensure a positive inter-event time, our approach eliminates the risk of Zeno behavior. Additionally, the framework integrates auxiliary variables to capture both flow and jump dynamics, and through Lyapunov consensus analysis, we establish L2 stability with finite gain, ensuring system resilience under Byzantine attacks. This research demonstrates that HDETM optimizes communication efficiency and enhances the system's ability to withstand Byzantine disruptions. Extensive numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in achieving robust consensus, highlighting its superiority over existing approaches.}

The ongoing transformations in the business landscape have brought human-machine interaction and multi-agent systems to the forefront. This underscores the importance of theories that bridge the gap between human brain processes and business-to-business marketing practices. Despite the potential of neuroscience in business-to-business marketing, such interdisciplinary research is extensively lacking. This paper employs systematic literature reviews and co-citation analyses to: a) establish the absence of business-to-business marketing–neuroscience research; b) investigate the ways in which the broader business and management discipline has bridged with neuroscience to inspire such integration between business-to-business marketing and neuroscience; c) describe bridging approaches; and d) propose a research agenda for business-to-business marketing. The co-citation analyses show that the business and management discipline has focused on the ‘within-brain’ or behavioural aspects of neuroscience. In addition, the discipline has continually integrated new neuroscience insights or increasingly developed theories that are internalised within the discipline, independent of neuroscience. The paper's main contributions are the reviews and co-citation analyses, as well as an account of bridging in interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, the proposed research agenda enhances our understanding of the potential of neuroscience in business-to-business marketing.}

Its core characteristics, including ubiquity, seamlessness, immersion, interoperability and metaspatiotemporality, are catalyzing the development of multiple technologies and fostering a convergence between the physical and virtual worlds. Despite its potential, the critical concept of symbiosis, which involves the synchronous generation and management of virtuality from reality and serves as the cornerstone of this convergence, is often overlooked. Additionally, cumbersome service designs, stemming from the intricate interplay of various technologies and inefficient resource utilization, are impeding an ideal Metaverse ecosystem. To address these challenges, we propose a bi-model Parallel Symbiotic Metaverse (PSM) system, engineered with a Cybertwin-enabled 6G framework where Cybertwins mirror Sensing Devices (SDs) and serve a bridging role as autonomous agents. Based on this framework, the system is structured into two models. In the queue model, SDs capture environmental data that Cybertwins then coordinate and schedule. In the service model, Cybertwins manage service requests and collaborate with SDs to make responsive decisions. We incorporate two algorithms to address resource scheduling and virtual service responses, showcasing the synergistic role of Cybertwins. Moreover, our PSM system advocates for the participation of SDs from collaborators, enhancing performance while reducing operational costs for Virtual Service Operator (VSO). Finally, we comparatively analyze the efficiency and complexity of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the efficacy of the PSM system across multiple performance indicators. The results indicate our system can be deployed cost-effectively with Cybertwin-enabled 6G.}

This paper elaborates on conceptual and formal models of digital twins in the supply chain. First, we define a new notion named digital supply chain ecosystem extending the recently developed intelligent digital twin framework. A digital ecosystem is a set of digital technologies, AI-based knowledge management systems, cloud spaces, and platforms that encapsulate supply chain data enabling digital twins and simulation models. Second, we elaborate on a digital twin as a complex phenomenon comprising systems, technological-organizational models, and management decision-making support perspectives. We offer a dynamic, quantitative framework for digital twins as a decision-making support and modeling environment using control theory. Third, we introduce two views of building and adapting digital twins, i.e., object-driven and data-driven approaches. Their principle schemes are defined and discussed. Finally, we outline a generalized framework of the cyber-physical supply chain comprised of a digital ecosystem, digital twin, human-AI collaboration space, and the physical supply chain. Application scenarios are considered, e.g., using digital twins for stress testing of supply chain resilience in the setting of tariff-driven shocks as well as building resilient and viable agricultural ecosystems.}

In this article, by utilizing control strategy with distributed delays in denial-of-service attack's presence for discrete-time multi-agent system of fractional-order, the leader-following cyber secure consensus problem is examined. Nonlinear functions have been assumed in the leader and follower equation of the system to study variations due to this function in the system. As multi-agent system is networked environment, in response to numerous threats, their security control becomes critically desirable, for example, denial of service. The consensus performance may be destabilized by resulting topologies which are caused by Denial-of-Service attacks. The connectivity between agents is destroyed, especially under connectivity-broken attacks. In order to overcome these problems, the strategy of novel defense which consists of consensus (with distributed delays) control is introduced. By using Caputo fractional difference operator sufficient criteria which includes the condition in terms LMI is derived and by using Lyapunov function approach, average dwell time and algebraic graph theory for security of addressed system's cyber secure consensus this is done for determining the obtained system of error's stability.

Here, non-focal firms face specific challenges, since they have little leverage over the ecosystems in which they operate. In the case of the metaverse – which can be conceptualised as a series of emerging-technology-based DBEs – dynamic sensing capabilities (DSCs) are particularly important for grasping this potentially vast albeit vague opportunity. Our explorative study of 14 virtual reality companies operating in Germany operationalises the microfoundations of these DSCs. Based on 25 interviews with commercial and technical top management executives, we introduce taxonomic differentiation and explore the impact of size/resource base and business model/market type (B2B/B2C) on DSCs. We find that productive opportunism and bricolage behaviour allow non-focal firms to navigate the sheer complexity of the environment. Social screening helps to unlock tacit knowledge as do knowledge-creating routines such as technical experimentation and co-creation (with customers, suppliers and even competitors). Furthermore, our findings enlarge the understanding of DBEs as not horizontally competing but as being organised in a downstream–upstream relationship. Moreover, we find that (commercially oriented) opportunity screening is closely and crucially linked with dynamic seizing capabilities (e.g. customer-driven prototyping and business model development).}

The concept of UDTs exhibits ‘interpretative flexibility’, allowing policymakers, technologists, urban planners and citizens to impose their values, needs and expectations onto the technology while sustaining a shared understanding of its potential. A key question arises: how can perspectives on UDTs within these actor-networks be identified and guide future innovation? Using the Q methodology for ‘boundary spanning’, the authors investigated the range of perspectives on UDTs and their influence on shaping regional innovation strategies. The research included some intervention-oriented aims and engaged 29 participants from governmental, industrial, and academic sectors involved in UDT initiatives in a regional urban network in the Netherlands. In interviews, participants completed a card-sorting task, ranking 41 statements that addressed five critical dimensions: Terminology, Values, Impact, Innovation and Strategy. The analysis revealed three dominant perspectives: (1) Strategic Confidence in UDTs; (2) Cautious Critique of UDTs; and (3) Technological Pragmatism for UDTs. The findings from this Q study fostered a better understanding of the UDT perspectives and cross-sector collaboration in the urban network, leading to more dynamic and adaptive UDT strategies.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the behavior of fractional-order nonlinear multi-agent systems subjected to Byzantine assaults, specifically focusing on the manipulations of both sensors and actuators. We employ weighted graphs, both directed and undirected, to illustrate the system's topology. Our methodology combines algebraic graph theory with fractional-order Lyapunov techniques to develop algebraic requirements for leader-following consensus, providing a robust framework for analyzing consensus dynamics in these complex systems. We present quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach, including two numerical examples that validate the proposed requirements for consensus evaluation. Notably, our work highlights the novelty of using fractional-order systems to enhance resilience against adversarial conditions, contributing significantly to the field of multi-agent systems. By clarifying key terms and streamlining our language, we ensure accessibility for a broader audience while emphasizing the implications of our findings for real-world applications.}

In the absence of relevant empirical studies, the aim of this article is to analyze the positive and negative aspects of the user experience in a cultural event held in the metaverse. A mixed-methods approach is employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results from three focus groups demonstrated the difficulty that users face in focusing their attention on the main elements of the metaverse, and the inability of this virtual sphere to convey the authenticity of a cultural event. Based on these findings, a metaverse-focused quantitative study was conducted to examine whether perceived gamification mitigate the negative effects of users failing to pay attention in their metaverse experiences. When users increased their attention levels, their ability to imagine the real experience and their perceptions of the authenticity of the cultural event increased, which produced positive behavioral intentions. This is one of the first studies to empirically analyze the tourist experience in the metaverse; managers and policymakers can benefit from the results to hold valuable virtual cultural events.}

This novel e-commerce platform offers a fresh approach to shopping, with Generation Z primarily exploring this innovative technology. Our research examines shopping within the Metaverse by developing a model based on the ’Uses and Gratifications Theory’ and Metaverse-related factors. A total of 1220 Gen Z consumers were surveyed, and data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Further, analysis of collected data was done using PLS-SEM. The results reveal that information seeking, perceived enjoyment, escapism, social interaction, sense of immersion, and personalization influence the shopping intention in the Metaverse, and perceived risk negatively influences the shopping intention of consumers. Further, shopping intention influences the potential use of Metaverse for shopping, and this relationship is moderated by technological innovativeness. This investigation into the adoption of the Metaverse for retail purposes augments the current Metaverse research and enhances the uses and gratifications theory within the Metaverse domain. Metaverse e-commerce professionals, including managers and developers, can acquire valuable perspectives on consumer shopping tendencies in the Metaverse from this study.}

It suggests recovering the evolutionary, social, institutional, ethical and humanistic precepts of political economy. Following this more plural and European conceptual orientation, the analysis shows that current inequality arises from a digital R&D&I process plagued by network, platform, bias and polarisation effects, from business models that foster automation, and from the emergence of large superstar firms or control organisations with excessive market and political power. The redirection of technological progress towards more democratic individual values and shared social welfare requires digital governance based on new incentives and taxes, a greater strategic and political orientation towards social sustainability, and a new transformative role for the State.}

abstract = {The adoption of the Computing Continuum is characterised by the seamless integration of diverse computing environments and devices. In this dynamic landscape, sharing resources across the continuum is becoming a reality and security must move an step forward, specially in terms of authentication and authorisation for such a distributed and heterogeneous environments. The need for robust identity management is paramount and, in this regard, Decentralised Identity Management (DIM) emerges as a promising solution. It leverages decentralised technologies to secure and facilitate identity interactions across the Computing Continuum. Particularly, to enhance security and privacy, it would be desirable to apply the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). In this paradigm, users have full ownership and control of their digital identities that empowers individuals to manage and share their identity data on a need-to-know basis. These mechanisms could contribute to improve security properties during continuum resource management operations. In this context, this paper presents the design, workflows and implementation of a solution that provides authentication/authorisation features to distributed zero-trust based infrastructures across the continuum, enhancing security in resource sharing and resource acquisition stages. To this aim, the solution relies on key aspects like decentralisation, interoperability, trust management and privacy-enhancing capabilities. The decentralisation leverages distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain, to establish a decentralised identity ecosystem. The solution prioritises interoperability, enabling nodes to seamlessly access and share their identities across different domains and environments. Trustworthiness is at the core of DIM, and privacy is also considered, incorporating privacy-preserving techniques that individuals to selectively disclose identity attributes while safeguarding sensitive information. The implementation includes different operations for allowing continuum frameworks to be enhanced with decentralised authentication and authorisation features. The performance has been evaluated measuring the impact for the adoption of the solution. The most expensive task, the self-identity generation, takes only a few seconds (in our deployment) and it is only executed once. Authorisation tasks operate in the millisecond range, which is a totally invaluable time if incorporated into resource acquisition processes in frameworks such as Liqo, used in the scope of FLUIDOS project.}

abstract = {Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted different real-time services, predominantly in the healthcare domain. One such real-time IoT-based application is telesurgery, where surgeons remotely transmit surgery instructions to a robotic arm, enabling it to conduct surgical procedures on patients. Since these surgical instructions use conventional wireless networks, they can leveraged by the attackers to manipulate them and manoeuvre the entire telesurgery application. Therefore, in this paper, we used emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), garlic routing (GR) networks, and blockchain, to propose an AI- and GR-based secure data instruction architecture for telesurgery applications in the healthcare 4.0 domain. A standard sensor dataset is utilized to train different AI algorithms, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU), for classifying malicious and non-malicious telesurgery data. Further, the non-malicious data is forwarded to the GR network that provides an end-to-end encrypted tunnel using ElGamal and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). ElGamal encryption encrypts the session tags for each telesurgery data relayed between surgeons and the robotic arm. The tags are stored in the immutable blockchain nodes to avoid data tampering attacks that strengthen the legitimacy of the garlic routers. Among both, the GRU outperforms with test accuracy 96.89%, precision 97.32%, recall 96.46%, F1 score 96.86%, and training loss 3%. Furthermore, the telesurgery data is transmitted via an AES-based outbound tunnel and received via an AES-based inbound tunnel, offering robust security against the security threats associated with the telesurgery application. To improve the network performance, we used essential characteristics (ultra-low latency, high speed, and high reliability) of the 5G network interface between each layer of the proposed architecture. The proposed architecture is evaluated using different evaluation metrics, such as statistical analysis (training accuracy, training loss, optimizer performance, activation function performance), data compromisation rate (0.346), network throughput (1.44 Mbps), error rate, and latency comparison.}

The materials employed in this study include a diverse set of heterogeneous agents designed to mirror real-world dynamics and delay characteristics. The methods involve the formulation of the consensus condition using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) and Kronecker product techniques, complemented by Lyapunov functional approaches for rigorous system stability analysis.

Leveraging Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), the research validates prior findings and introduces a conceptual model outlining factors that shape attitudes toward adopting GAI in DM to enhance customer experiences. A qualitative inductive approach was undertaken by conducting expert interviews to investigate the “reasons for” and ‘reasons against’ using GAI in DM and its impact on customer experience. The transcripts generated were manually coded and a deductive thematic analysis was done using the BRT as the theoretical framework. The findings indicate four significant themes for adopting GAI in digital marketing viz: innovation, creative communication and content creation, speed, efficiency and timesaving, enhanced customization and personalization; predictive analytics and simulation. It also indicates five significant themes related to the key barriers were also identified viz: ethics and infringement of Intellectual Property; security and deepfake; learning ecosystem for the adoption of new technology; quality of data; reduced manpower requirement.

In Study 1, we initially conceptualize the attributes of the metaverse and develop scales for assessing the metaverse characteristics. Subsequently, we evaluate the validity and reliability of this metric through the analysis of data acquired from 106 participants utilizing prominent metaverse platforms such as Zepeto, Roblox, and Ifland. In Study 2, we establish a theoretical model by associating metaverse characteristics with experiential value users perceive and appraising the construct's utility to account for an individual's continuance intention. The proposed model was tested through a sample of 218 metaverse users. The findings of Study 1 demonstrate that the metaverse is delineated by five factors: seamlessness, interoperability, concurrence, presence, and creator economy. The results of Study 2 reveal that, despite the creator economy being a legitimate attribute of the metaverse, its impact on a user's experiential value remains insignificant in the current metaverse platforms. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on the metaverse by developing scales and testing their utility. The outcomes are anticipated to yield practical insights for metaverse service providers on strategies for sustaining user engagement by leveraging the inherent attributes of the metaverse.}

abstract = {Context:
The term metaverse refers to a persistent, virtual, three-dimensional environment where individuals may communicate, engage, and collaborate. One of the most multifaceted and challenging use cases of the metaverse is education, where educators and learners may require multiple technical, social, psychological, and interaction instruments to accomplish their learning objectives. While the characteristics of the metaverse might nicely fit the problem’s needs, our research points out a noticeable lack of knowledge into (1) the specific requirements that an educational metaverse should actually fulfill to let educators and learners successfully interact towards their objectives and (2) how to design an appropriate educational metaverse for both educators and learners.
Objective:
In this paper, we aim to bridge this knowledge gap by proposing SENEM, a novel software engineering-enabled educational metaverse. We first elicit a set of functional requirements that an educational metaverse should fulfill.
Method:
In this respect, we conduct a literature survey to extract the currently available knowledge on the matter discussed by the research community, and afterward, we assess and complement such knowledge through semi-structured interviews with educators and learners. Upon completing the requirements elicitation stage, we then build our prototype implementation of SENEM, a metaverse that makes available to educators and learners the features identified in the previous stage. Finally, we evaluate the tool in terms of learnability, efficiency, and satisfaction through a Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation research approach, leading us to the iterative refinement of our prototype.
Results:
Through our survey strategy, we extracted nine requirements that guided the tool development that the study participants positively evaluated.
Conclusion:
Our study reveals that the target audience appreciates the elicited design strategy. Our work has the potential to form a solid contribution that other researchers can use as a basis for further improvements.}

abstract = {How are new-age technologies transforming business operations? Why does it matter? The article suggests that a market management approach is conducive to understanding how new-age technologies can transform business operations. In this regard, the article defines market management approach as a holistic framework for managing transformative business operations that emphasizes the integration of emerging technologies with an organization’s operational processes. In this regard, the concept of transformative business operations is introduced and defined as the transformation of organizational systems, resources, and processes using new-age technologies to improve business functions that can generate superior value offerings to all stakeholders. The proposed transformative business operations approach identifies three triggers—the tension of uncertainty, adaptive capabilities, and operational elasticity—that drive the unique and synergistic impacts of these technologies. These triggers result in transformative changes through (a) foundational shifts in organizations, (b) strategy design, execution, and optimization, (c) unified ecosystem creation, and (d) pioneering business operations solutions. The actual transformation is observed in hyper-automation, augmented decision-making, and decentralized supply chains. The article also highlights barriers to adopting these technologies - cultural and workforce adjustments, data security and privacy concerns, and interoperability issues -, which moderate their potential impact, and guide organizations navigating these challenges. Finally, it outlines a market management agenda for exploring the implications of these developments.}

abstract = {The metaverse has the potential to extend the physical world using augmented and virtual reality technologies allowing users to seamlessly interact within real and simulated environments using avatars and holograms. Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda that is valuable for researchers, professionals and policy makers alike.}

In the metaverse, which will become a virtual asset in the future, users’ communication, movement with characters, text elements, etc., are required to integrate the real and virtual. However, they can be exposed to threats. Particularly, various hacker threats exist. For example, users’ assets are exposed through notices and mail alerts regularly sent to users by operators. In the future, hacker threats will increase mainly due to naturally anonymous texts. Therefore, it is necessary to use the natural language processing technology of artificial intelligence, especially term frequency-inverse document frequency, word2vec, gated recurrent unit, recurrent neural network, and long-short term memory. Additionally, several application versions are used. Currently, research on tasks and performance for algorithm application is underway. We propose a grouping algorithm that focuses on securing various bridgehead strategies to secure topics for security and safety within the metaverse. The algorithm comprises three modules: extracting topics from attacks, managing dimensions, and performing grouping. Consequently, we create 24 topic-based models. Assuming normal and spam mail attacks to verify our algorithm, the accuracy of the previous application version was increased by ∼0.4%–1.5%.}

To promote safe, sustainable, and inclusive urban mobility, understanding and predicting the behaviors of pedestrians and cyclists, including their intentions, decisions, and movements, when they interact with autonomous systems becomes crucial. Gaining a thorough understanding of these complex interactions can not only improve the safety, efficiency, and acceptance of autonomous systems but also enhance the design and implementation of these technologies. Through a comprehensive review of the literature spanning the years 2014 to 2023, we identify 99 articles that empirically investigate the interactions of humans and autonomous systems. Based on our overview of progress and challenges within this field, we further identify five research gaps that future research should address to enhance human-autonomous system interactions, including: (1) scaling up experimental scenarios to multi-user and multi-modal setups to better represent real-world challenges, (2) emphasizing safety-critical scenarios that are difficult to achieve in real-world environments by applying virtual reality, (3) incorporating diverse behavioral data from the human perspective to deepen the understanding of vulnerable road user behavior and decisions, (4) embracing continuous and real-time interaction to better predict dynamic future environments, and (5) enhancing the generalization ability to ensure realism and broad applicability. This review article offers valuable insights for the growing human-autonomous system research community, specifically those interested in leveraging controlled experiments to enhance the understanding and prediction of pedestrians' and cyclists' behaviors in future urban environments.}

While digital transformation can help support and meet the growth needs of the fishery and aquaculture industries, few studies explore digital technology adoption in aquaculture and even fewer consider the diverse perspectives of various actors in this context. We aim to fill this gap by examining the viewpoints of key rainbow trout farming stakeholders, such as producers, researchers, and technology providers, regarding adopting digital technologies. This study, which is unique in the Ontario context, employed Q methodology to explore the perspectives of different actors using the extended theory of planned behaviour as a framework. We performed the Q-sort procedure using Qualtrics, providing 23 actors with 27 statements on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Q-factor analysis in PQ-method software identified three distinct discourses. Discourse 1 highlights skilled employees and data-related concerns, Discourse 2 emphasises understanding the complexity and costs associated with digital technologies, and Discourse 3 emphasises financial assistance and perceived value, focusing on attitude and perceived behavioural control. Interestingly, the three discourses were represented by various groups of actors, and not all respondents from the same sector shared the same perception. The findings of this study contribute to the limited scientific research on digital technology adoption in rainbow trout farming, which can inform strategic policy decisions.}

However, the technology that enhances our lives presents a dual reality—it offers opportunities for criminals while creating challenges for law enforcement. Fraud, particularly, has become a pervasive issue. In response, virtual asset service providers must take measures to tackle cryptocurrency-related fraud. Nevertheless, this becomes challenging if the perpetrator exists solely within the virtual world. In 1992, Neal Stephenson used the term ‘Metaverse’ to describe a virtual world where people interact with each other using avatars. Over time, the Metaverse has transformed into a complex concept akin to 'cyberspace'. The Metaverse is a virtual environment that uses technologies to mimic the real world. As this virtual space became intertwined with financial transactions, especially through cryptocurrencies, the Metaverse evolved into a medium for perpetrating scams. Within this context, the article addresses the challenges associated with criminal activity in the Metaverse. Considering the potential applications of AI, cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens, three main challenges can be identified: 1) decentralisation, 2) anonymity of the user, and 3) lack of regulation. This article examines the applicability of existing legislation to regulate criminal activity in the Metaverse through doctrinal research. Using a comparative approach, it analyses the challenges of addressing virtual crimes by contrasting fraud (Fraud Act 2006) with sexual assault (Sexual Offences Act 2003), highlighting the complexity of addressing crimes involving physical contact in virtual spaces compared to financial crimes.}

In this sense, the literature highlights the need to address research gaps in terms of the levels of acceptance of this new technology and with regard to the challenges faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the tourism sector. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to assess the adoption intention of high technology in tourism by small and medium-sized enterprises, focusing on the key role of the Metaverse as a new paradigm. For data collection, a total of 172 small and medium-sized enterprises have been surveyed using a double methodology, PLS-SEM and QCA, for the analysis. The results show that small and medium-sized tourism enterprises intend to adopt technologies associated with the Metaverse for the concept of Business Satisfaction rather than for the possible performance it may represent. These results represent an important advance in the understanding of the integration of Metaverse technologies in the tourism sector in this type of companies, where it can help to adopt diverse strategies in the business environment without having an excessive Resistance to Change, helping to be able to face it in conjunction with other capabilities.}

abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs), being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, share valuable knowledge of the underlying physical processes and act as data acquisition and dissemination sources to Cyber–Physical System (CPS). Moreover, without obstructing the ongoing operations, DTs also provide an assessment platform for evaluating the operational behavior and security of the CPS. Therefore, they become a potential source of data breaches and a broad attack surface for attackers to launch covert attacks. To detect and mitigate security loopholes in DTs, one of the potential solutions is to leverage a gamification approach that can assess the security level of DTs while providing security analysts with a controlled and supportive virtual training environment. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based approaches can complement the idea of security orchestration and automation in the gamification approach. However, AI/ML-based DTs security solutions are generally constrained by the lack of transparency of AI operations, which results in less confidence in the decisions made by the AI models. To address the explainable security challenges of DTs, this article proposes a gamification approach called sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA). While leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming scenarios to assess DTs’ security and train security analysts. The game players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI agents (the defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based DT security assessment model that explains the decisions made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack vectors for the defender team, i.e., the AI agent. The SHAP values illustrate the contribution of different features towards predicting the outcome of attack vectors. This explanation can help security analysts to take security measures based on reasoned and trustworthy decisions. Finally, experimental validation has been carried out to demonstrate the viability of ENIGMA.}

This research investigates decision-making within collaborative online games, where players face the challenge of optimizing their character's value through strategic NFT acquisition. This challenge is analogous to the Knapsack Problem, aiming to maximize the value of items selected within a limited capacity, just as players seek to maximize character rarity within budget constraints. We propose a Decision Support System (DSS) employing genetic algorithms to assist players in tackling this complex optimization problem. A simulation framework, based on the "SunflowerLand" Metaverse, demonstrates that players using the DSS achieve significantly higher character rarity, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance player experience.}

The “LearningverseVR” platform uses Unity as the client and Python, Flask and MySQL as the backend. Unity's multiplayer service provides multiplayer online functionality, supporting learners to engage in immersive and interactive learning activities. The design framework of the platform consists of two main components: Game-based learning with generative AI and immersion with VR technologies. First, generative AI is used to create NPCs with diverse personalities and life backgrounds, and enable learners to interact with NPCs without scripted dialogues, creating an interactive and immersive game-based learning environment. Secondly, such a learning experience is enhanced by leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem with VR technology.

abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is essential knowledge concerning cyber and physical threats aimed at mitigating potential cyber attacks. The rapid evolution of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 5.0 has spawned a multitude of sources regarding current or potential cyber threats against organizations. Consequently, CTI sharing among organizations holds considerable promise for facilitating swift responses to attacks and enabling mutual benefits through active participation. However, exchanging CTI among different organizations poses significant challenges, including legal and regulatory obligations, interoperability standards, and data reliability. The current CTI sharing landscape remains inadequately explored, hindering a comprehensive examination of organizations’ critical needs and the challenges they encounter during CTI sharing. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on CTI sharing, beginning with an exploration of CTI fundamentals and its advancements in assessing cyber and physical threats and threat actors from various perspectives. For instance, we discuss the benefits of CTI, its applications, and diverse CTI sharing architectures. Additionally, we extensively discuss a list of CTI sharing challenges and evaluate how available CTI sharing proposals address these challenges. Finally, we provide an inventory of unique future research directions to offer insightful guidelines for CTI sharing.}

abstract = {Since Facebook officially changed its name to Meta in Oct. 2021, the metaverse has become a new norm of social networks and three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds. The metaverse aims to bring 3D immersive and personalized experiences to users by leveraging many pertinent technologies. Despite great attention and benefits, a natural question in the metaverse is how to secure its users’ digital content and data. In this regard, blockchain is a promising solution owing to its distinct features of decentralization, immutability, and transparency. To better understand the role of blockchain in the metaverse, we aim to provide an extensive survey on the applications of blockchain for the metaverse. We first present a preliminary to blockchain and the metaverse and highlight the motivations behind the use of blockchain for the metaverse. Next, we extensively discuss blockchain-based methods for the metaverse from technical perspectives, such as data acquisition, data storage, data sharing, data interoperability, and data privacy preservation. For each perspective, we first discuss the technical challenges of the metaverse and then highlight how blockchain can help. Moreover, we investigate the impact of blockchain on key-enabling technologies in the metaverse, including Internet-of-Things, digital twins, multi-sensory and immersive applications, artificial intelligence, and big data. We also present some major projects to showcase the role of blockchain in metaverse applications and services. Finally, we present some promising directions to drive further research innovations and developments toward the use of blockchain in the metaverse in the future.}
