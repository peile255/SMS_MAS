Externalities and complementarities in platforms and ecosystems: From structural solutions to endogenous failures,"Platforms and ecosystems provide structures for constellations of economic actors to engage and interact as they seek to create and capture value. We consider how the constructs of platforms and ecosystems relate and explore why they have become more ubiquitous by focusing on the nature of their value-add. We propose that they emerge as a response to distinct market failures, which we identify, and we explain which specific externalities they help overcome. We also identify post-hoc endogenous functional and distributional failures that platforms and ecosystems, in turn, generate. We discuss implications for theory and practice.","Platforms, Ecosystems, Complementarities, Externalities, Value creation, Coordination, Market failures, Platform governance, Ecosystem governance, Platform failures, Ecosystem failures"
Unveiling the metaverse: The mediating role of social interaction in enhancing tourism experiences,"This study explores the influence of metaverse experiences and social interaction on tourists’ engagement and satisfaction in virtual tourism environments. In the digital era, the metaverse provides an immersive, interactive platform for tourism, allowing users to experience destinations virtually. Drawing from theoretical frameworks on tourism experience, the metaverse experience in this study is categorized into three core dimensions: presence and telepresence, immersion, interactivity and vividness. Additionally, social interaction, which encompasses peer-to-peer engagement and community building within virtual settings, is examined as a mediating factor that may enhance the overall tourism experience. Data was collected from 400 tourists in Thailand and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test two primary hypotheses: first, that the metaverse has a direct positive influence on tourism experience, and second, that social interaction mediates this relationship. Results support both hypotheses, demonstrating that the metaverse significantly enhances tourism experience through its immersive and interactive features, with social interaction further amplifying this effect as a partial mediator. These findings suggest valuable implications for tourism practitioners and developers of virtual tourism platforms, emphasizing the need to integrate high-quality, socially engaging digital experiences. The study contributes to understanding how metaverse technology, combined with social engagement, can enrich virtual tourism and align with Thailand’s broader digital tourism initiatives.","Metaverse, Social Interaction, Tourism Experience, Immersive Technology"
Architecture for data-centric and semantic-enhanced industrial metaverse: Bridging physical factories and virtual landscape,"The metaverse paradigm has recently captured increasing scholarly and industrial attention, particularly within the scope of human-centric Industry 5.0. In this context, the metaverse promises a transformative confluence of the physical and digital realms, offering unparalleled avenues for human augmentation in industrial applications. Yet, while several conceptual metaverse architectures and illustrative case studies have emerged, they scarcely delve deep into the nuanced practice of cultivating the industrial metaverse for factory-scale applications. Addressing this research gap, this work introduces a novel architecture for a data-centric and semantic-enhanced industrial metaverse. The architecture intricately weaves the physical factory domain with the metaverse, fortified by a suite of ten modules, facilitating data flow and knowledge synchronization with the integration of digital twins and semantic models. The practical application and relevance of this architecture are further accentuated through a case study focused on in-plant material flow tracking. Emerging results underline that our architecture encapsulates the essential components for constructing a factory-scale industrial metaverse. Future research will be geared towards a comprehensive validation of the proposed metaverse architecture, culminating in tangible implementations across diverse industrial contexts.","Industrial metaverse, Virtual–physical continuum, Digital twins, Extended reality, Architecture, Industry 5.0"
Technical and System Requirements for Industrial Robot-as-a-Service (IRaaS),"Industrial Robot as a Service (IRaaS) is a new business model that enables SMEs to quickly adapt to changing production demands. The IRaaS model introduces industrial robots that can be rented and used on demand, requiring little to no programming knowledge. With this shift from capital expenditures (CAPEX) to operational expenditures (OPEX), the cost of ownership and expertise barriers are eliminated, allowing SMEs to avoid large upfront costs and providing greater flexibility. In this paper, the requirements for developing and realizing these new IRaaS services are identified. The functional requirements are identified by first eliciting the non-functional requirements and proposing robotic concepts that can be servitized. The requirements are also mapped into IRaaS concepts and converged to the underlying challenges.","Industrial-Robots-as-a-Service (IRaaS), Robotic Systems Engineering, Requirements Engineering, Manufacturing Servitization"

The paper concludes with formulating future research agendas and presenting contributions to literature and implications for practice.","Service industries, Metaverse, Opportunities, Challenges, Research agenda"
Game on! A state-of-the-art overview of doing business with gamification,"Gamification is the act of applying game-design elements to transform activities, products, services, and systems in a way that provides the kind of experiences similar to those offered by games. These elements include badges, points, and leaderboards to motivate and reward problem solving activities and processes. Both businesses and business researchers are increasingly interested in the application of gamification. In this regard, this review aims to offer a state-of-the-art overview of gamification in business, revealing its current trends and future directions. Using business research on gamification published in the last decade (2012–2022) found on Scopus and Web of Science, we conduct a performance analysis to illuminate the field's performance (publication productivity and impact) alongside its key contributors (journals, authors, and countries) as well as a science mapping using a co-citation analysis to locate knowledge foundations, and bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence analysis to reveal major themes in business gamification.

Digital forensics for the socio-cyber world (DF-SCW): A novel framework for deepfake multimedia investigation on social media platforms,"Owing to the major development of social media platforms, the usage of technological adaptation increases by means of editing software tools. Posting media in social communication environments has become one of our common daily routines. Before posting, various editing generators are used to manipulate pixel values, such as for enhancing brightness and contrast. Undoubtedly, this software helps bring posting media from ordinary to outstanding. But such a type of editing crosses the line in terms of creating fakes—anything that comes from anywhere and does not retain its originality anyway. It poses a series of issues in the process of multimedia forensics investigation and chain of custody. In order to restrict the attempts at deep faking and make the investigation hierarchy more effective, efficient, and reliable in the socio-cyber space (SCS), this paper presents a novel framework called DF-SCW. A digital forensics-enabled socio-cyber world with artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep neural networks (DNNs), for detecting and analyzing deep fake media investigations on social media platforms. It compares pixels with their neighboring values in the same media (such as images and videos) to identify information about the original one. There is a media flag designed to filter out malicious and dangerous attempts, like a powerful leader declaring war. Putting flags on such fakes helps digital investigators resist sharing the posts. In addition, the other prospect of this research is to make the digital forensics ecosystem more appropriate to take qualitative judgments in real-time while media is uploaded on social media platforms. The simulation of the proposed DF-SCW is tested on three different platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Through the experiment, the DF-SCW outperformed in terms of detection, identification, and analysis of deepfake media by an increased rate of 3.77%.","Multimedia forensics, Artificial intelligence, Deepfake investigation, Socio-cyber environment, Social media platforms"
Framing metaverse identity: A multidimensional framework for governing digital selves,"This paper proposes a multidimensional framework for Metaverse Identity, addressing its definition, guiding principles, and critical challenges. Metaverse Identity is conceptualized as a user’s digital self, encompassing personal attributes, data footprints, social roles, and economic elements. To elucidate its core characteristics and implications, this framework introduces two guiding principles: Equivalence and Alignment and Fusion and Expansiveness. The first principle advocates for consistency between metaverse and real-world identities in behavioral norms and social standards, ensuring rights protection and establishing conduct guidelines. The second emphasizes the deep integration and transformative evolution of metaverse identities, enabling them to transcend real-world constraints, meet diverse needs, and foster inclusivity. Together, two principles serve as complementary pillars, balancing ethical integration with dynamic co-evolution. Building on this foundation, the study identifies five critical challenges: interoperability, legal boundaries, privacy and identity management, risks from deepfakes and synthetic identities, and identity fragmentation impacting psychological well-being. To address these challenges, strategic recommendations are offered to guide stakeholders. By constructing this framework, the study fills a key theoretical gap, advances systematic research, and provides a foundation for policies and governance strategies to address the complexities of metaverse identities in a rapidly evolving digital domain.","Metaverse, Digital Identity, Metaverse Identity, Digital Selves, Artificial intelligence, Interoperability, Privacy, Deepfakes, Synthetic identity, Identity fragmentation"
Blockchain user digital identity big data and information security process protection based on network trust,"This study aims to delve into the knowledge graph, functional pathways, and qualitative logic among elements such as network trust, blockchain organization, user identity, big data, and information security in the digital economy era. Through an analysis of the endogenous and exogenous explicit management logic relationships among these elements, this study innovatively constructs three primary dimensions and nine secondary dimensions of digital identity attributes for users. Additionally, it establishes a collaborative management mechanism between government organizations and non-governmental blockchain alliances corresponding to identity attributes based on the delegated proxy mechanism. Furthermore, it reconstructs the big data chain management framework for user digital identity under the zero-trust model and establishes a management process for blockchain digital identity information security protection under the zero-trust model. These efforts provide innovative solutions with both research and application value for the “virtual-real integration” global security governance of the metaverse, digital economy, and digital government.","Blockchain, Information security, Big data, Digital identity, Network trust"
Chasing in virtual environment:Dynamic alignment for multi-user collaborative redirected walking,"Background The redirected walking (RDW) method for multi-user collaboration requires maintaining the relative position between users in a virtual environment (VE) and physical environment (PE). A chasing game in a VE is a typical virtual reality game that entails multi-user collaboration. When a user approaches and interacts with a target user in the VE, the user is expected to approach and interact with the target user in the corresponding PE as well. Existing methods of multi-user RDW mainly focus on obstacle avoidance, which does not account for the relative positional relationship between the users in both VE and PE. Methods To enhance the user experience and facilitate potential interaction, this paper presents a novel dynamic alignment algorithm for multi-user collaborative redirected walking (DA-RDW) in a shared PE where the target user and other users are moving. This algorithm adopts improved artificial potential fields, where the repulsive force is a function of the relative position and velocity of the user with respect to dynamic obstacles. For the best alignment, this algorithm sets the alignment-guidance force in several cases and then converts it into a constrained optimization problem to obtain the optimal direction. Moreover, this algorithm introduces a potential interaction object selection strategy for a dynamically uncertain environment to speed up the subsequent alignment. To balance obstacle avoidance and alignment, this algorithm uses the dynamic weightings of the virtual and physical distances between users and the target to determine the resultant force vector. Results The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated using a series of simulations and live-user experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our novel dynamic alignment method for multi-user collaborative redirected walking can reduce the distance error in both VE and PE to improve alignment with fewer collisions.","Virtual reality, Multi-user redirected walking, User collisions, Dynamic alignment"

This paper reviews the foundational concepts, methodologies, and applications of digital twins in engineering design, covering both their architecture and development (engineering of digital twins), and their utilisation to enhance design activities (engineering with digital twins). An overview of the current state-of-the-art is presented, challenges are highlighted, and future research directions are addressed.","Design, Digital twin, Digital twin engineering"
Transforming cinematography lighting education in the metaverse,"Lighting education is a foundational component of cinematography education. However, many art schools do not have expensive soundstages for traditional cinematography lessons. Migrating physical setups to virtual experiences is a potential solution driven by metaverse initiatives. Yet there is still a lack of knowledge on the design of a VR system for teaching cinematography. We first analyzed the educational needs for cinematography lighting education by conducting interviews with six cinematography professionals from academia and industry. Accordingly, we presented Art Mirror, a VR soundstage for teachers and students to emulate cinematography lighting in virtual scenarios. We evaluated Art Mirror from the aspects of usability, realism, presence, sense of agency, and collaboration. Sixteen participants were invited to take a cinematography lighting course and assess the design elements of Art Mirror. Our results demonstrate that Art Mirror is usable and useful for cinematography lighting education, which sheds light on the design of VR cinematography education.","Education, Learning, Virtual reality, System, Cinematography lighting"

A Conceptual Framework for Digital Twins of Multi-Agent Systems,"Multi-agent Systems (MASs) are complex systems made up of agents that can be any entities with the ability to interact autonomously and make decentralized decision-making to solve complex problems. Data-driven Agent-based Modeling and Simulation (DDABMS) equips MASs with access to decisions based on near-real-time data, allowing for more informed decisions for systems’ enhancements. Digital Twins (DTs) can further enhance MASs by serving as virtual replicas that enable what-if scenarios exploration and allow continuous validation and refinement of the underlying models with real-time data from MASs. However, we discovered a gap in systematically integrating DTs with DDABMS, as existing efforts focus on specific problems and domains rather than providing a generalized framework to develop DTs with DDABMS. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a generalized framework to develop DTs for MASs with DDABMS. To demonstrate the practicability of our proposed framework for modeling and simulation of complex systems, we present an illustrative case study based on an epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model.","digital twins, multi-agent systems, data-driven agent-based modeling, agent-based modeling, simulation, decision making"
A conceptual model and case study of blockchain-enabled social media platform,"Nowadays, with the emergence of Web 3.0 and the metaverse, we collectively witnessed the explosive development of the decentralised autonomous organisation and the blockchain business model. Particularly, the advancement of technologies has further given birth to a novel form of social platform as blockchain-enabled social media (i.e., SocialFi), which is growing both in size and number of users. Accordingly, the rapid development of these blockchain-enabled social media firms illustrates the requirement to better understand the reasons behind this increase and the innovative practices and strategies of firms in this emerging field. Using the case of Pixie – the world’s first fully functional decentralised photo and video sharing social network based on blockchain technology, this insight paper identifies a conceptual model of blockchain-enabled social media that is useful for illustrating the successful business strategy and operations of firms. Particularly, the identified model employs four pillars of innovation as fundamental technologies, governance and operations, incentive mechanism design, and organisational structure and performance. Based on this crypto economy social media model, the study further presents the main challenges, discusses the implications based on agency theory, as well as highlights several directions for future research associated with blockchain-enabled social media.","Social media, Blockchain, Decentralised autonomous organisation, Agency theory, Crypto economy"
Cyber-physical systems in non-rigid assemblies: A methodology for the calibration of deformable object reconstruction models,"Despite the advances in robot agent cognition and systems’ decision-making, under the prism of cyber-physical systems and industrial metaverse, the manufacturing processes involving the handling of non-rigid product assemblies present a delay in the adoption of smart automation. Model-based planning and control can address the particularities of deformable object manipulation; however, their competence is heavily dependent on the models’ accuracy and reconstruction frequencies. Despite the many breakthroughs that have been achieved in real-time modelling and behavior prediction of deformable objects, the calibration of such models and the measurement of their accuracy remain a significant challenge. In this paper, a method for the definition of the physics parameters of flexible material reconstruction models is presented. The proposed systematic approach, employing a number of optimization algorithms, fine-tunes the model’s parameters for the real-world deformable object, as captured by the perception system, to be aligned with its digital twin. A mass-spring model for the reconstruction of two-dimensional fabric objects is used as an application paradigm. An experimental setup in an industrially relevant environment validates the applicability of the proposed approach and is used for assessing alternative sensing practices and optimization algorithms.","Deformable object modeling, Bayesian optimization, Genetic algorithm, Cyber-physical systems, Perception, Metaverse"
The impact of eye gaze on social interactions of females in virtual reality: The mediating role of the uncanniness of avatars and the moderating role of task type,"The introduction of the Metaverse and the rise of social virtual reality platforms such as VRChat has led to increased communication and collaboration in virtual reality. As interactions in social virtual reality take place through avatars, the behaviour, and in particular the eye gaze of an avatar can have an impact on the user experience. However, it is still unclear which features of the user experience are most influenced. Therefore, this study used data from 44 female participants to investigate how avatar gaze behaviour (static eyes vs. real-time tracked eyes) affects their perceived quality of communication and the amount of one-sided eye contact participants make during a communicative or collaborative task in virtual reality. In addition, the study investigated the mediating role of perceived avatar “uncanniness” (i.e., the finding that humanoid objects that imperfectly resemble real people evoke feelings of discomfort) in this relationship and the moderation effect of two multi-user scenarios (collaboration vs. communication). The results showed that uncanniness directly affected the perceived quality of communication. However, it did not significantly mediate the relationship between avatar eye gaze behaviour and the quality of communication or the amount of one-sided eye contact. Finally, there were no significant differences in user experience between the two scenarios. From this, we can conclude that the uncanniness of an avatar being interacted with in VR is not enough to hinder communication and collaboration in an immersive medium. And even if an avatar is perceived as uncanny, normative communication cues such as eye contact are still present. Notably, due to sample availability, the results of this study are based on a female-only sample. Thus, future research can benefit from exploring the outlined effects in a more gender-balanced sample.","Virtual reality, Eye tracking, Multi-agent, Avatar uncanniness, Communication, Collaboration, Moderated mediation analysis"
Developing an assessment governance framework for urban digital twins: Insights from smart cities,"The rampant urbanization process has highlighted the need of an efficient governance for urban areas. Nevertheless, cities must face the challenge of adapting to technology advances arising from the digital era we are living in. Under this context, urban digital twins (UDTs) have recently superseded smart cities in the attempt of improving the management of city resources and the live of citizens through the use of sophisticated technology. Although the governance of smart cities has been broadly handled in the literature, the influence of UDTs on urban governance still remains unaddressed. This article aims at closing this gap by developing a framework to assess the contribution of UDTs in the governance of cities. A mixed methodology combining an in-depth literature review, a four-round Delphi technique and the Best-Worst multi-criteria decision making method was implemented to this end. The new instrument consists of a two-tier scheme comprising 7 categories and 33 attributes, of which 26 were deemed as essential for an efficient governance. Institutional dimension prevailed over the remaining sustainability domains. Three performance thresholds were defined: low governance, average governance and high governance. The application of the rating system to the UDT of Singapore as case study determined a high level of governance for this city. Some policies were however recommended to strengthen gaps found in Singapore.","Smart governance, Delphi technique, Smart cities, Governance assessment, Urban digital twin, Multi-criteria decision making, Best-Worst method"
Adaptive solutions for metaverse urban mobility through decision-making and blockchain,"In this paper, we utilise blockchain technology (BT) and circular q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (Cq-ROFS) to address practical issues related to urban transportation and supply chain management (SCM). Recognising the weaknesses of earlier approaches such as circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets (C-IFS), we work Cq-ROFS to better accommodate imprecise input. Novel approaches that use into metaverse settings are being investigated as a means of addressing the complex problems associated with urban mobility. This study use the SWARA-AROMAN approach to evaluate potential blockchain integration possibilities for metaverse urban mobility. Sensitivity analysis and comprehensive evaluation yield powerful insights into the robustness and adaptability of solutions. With these findings at their disposal, policymakers will be more equipped to take on unpredictability and take advantage of opportunities for sustainable urban mobility. To enhance urban transportation solutions in the dynamic metaverse, future strategies should concentrate on improving processes and exploring novel technology. Ultimately, this research emphasises how critical it is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and ongoing innovation if we hope to influence the patterns of urban mobility in the metaverse.","Supply chain management, SWARA, AROMAN, Electronic toll collection, Metaverse, Blockchain, Decision making, Car-sharing"
Decisions with ChatGPT: Reexamining choice overload in ChatGPT recommendations,"This research examines how individuals respond differently to recommendation options generated by ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model, in five studies. In contrast to previous research on choice overload, Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that people tend to respond positively to a large number of recommendation options (60 options), revealing diverse consumer perceptions of AI-generated recommendations. Studies 3 and 4 further illustrate the moderating effect of recommendation agents and indicate that choice overload elicits distinct patterns of consumer reactions depending on whether the recommendations are from a human or AI agent. Lastly, Study 5 directly measures consumer preferences for recommendation agents, revealing a general preference for ChatGPT, particularly when a large number of options are available. These findings have significant implications for recommendation system design and user preferences regarding AI-powered recommendations.","AI versus human recommendations, Artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, Choice overload, Recommendation agents"
Forearm Dual-Triboelectric Sensor (FDTS) for assistive Human-Machine-Interfaces (HMIs) and robotic control with potential uses in prosthetic devices,"This work describes a new sensitive non-intrusive forearm device with two triboelectric sensors (TS) integrated into one flexible PCB (FPCB) that indirectly differentiates finger and hand movements based on the forearm muscles and tendons' combined responses. The new Forearm Dual Triboelectric Sensor (FDTS) intends to demonstrate triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as an affordable and flexible alternative to expensive and bulky EMG devices used in prosthetic limbs by amputated patients. The proposed concept can successfully recognize up to 10 different input signals from the bending or tapping of the middle and little fingers and hand opening-closing action used as input commands for a Human-Computer-Interface (HCI) for computer navigation. In the experiments, we can successfully control horizontal, vertical and diagonal movements, left and right click of the cursor on the screen, and scroll up/down options. The FDTS was also implemented in robotic hand remote control, where different index and small finger bending amplitudes were translated to different mechanical finger rotation degrees and overall robot hand movement. Additionally, the robotic hand was able to perform right and left clicks controlled by fast finger bending. More experiments demonstrate the FDTS response to other wrist movements, such as pronation and supination. This proves the potential benefits of TS in cost-effective prosthetic devices, with limited but better functionality than standard body-powered prostheses. In the future, FDTS-like devices can be modularly integrated with artificial limbs to allow amputated patients to control computers and external devices. Additionally, this solution can positively impact the integration of online spaces like the Metaverse with healthcare technologies for rehabilitation and social inclusion.","Forearm Dual Triboelectric Sensor (FDTS), Flexible muscle triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), Robotic hand control, Prosthetic devices’ triboelectric nanogenerator, Future Metaverse computer navigation HMI, Forearm muscles assistive sensor"

"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for digital twins in the industrial metaverse: Overview, use cases, and open challenges","Recent years have witnessed the emergence of digital twins in the industrial metaverse, significantly transforming sectors such as manufacturing, automotive, oil and gas, and gaming. As a result, these sectors have experienced increased efficiency, innovation, and revolutionary solutions. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have the potential to enhance digital twins in the industrial metaverse by offering opportunities for monetization, traceability, and tracking. Moreover, NFTs can reshape the way industries operate by providing superior transparency, asset management, and intellectual property protection.

"A new technology perspective of the Metaverse: Its essence, framework and challenges","The Metaverse depicts a parallel digitalized world where virtuality and reality are fused. It has economic and social systems like those in the real world and provides intelligent services and applications. In this paper, we introduce the Metaverse from a new technology perspective, including its essence, corresponding technical framework, and potential technical challenges. Specifically, we analyze the essence of the Metaverse from its etymology and point out breakthroughs promising to be made in time, space, and contents of the Metaverse by citing Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Subsequently, we conclude four pillars of the Metaverse, named ubiquitous connections, space convergence, virtuality and reality interaction, and human-centered communication, and establish a corresponding technical framework. Additionally, we envision open issues and challenges of the Metaverse in the technical aspect. The work proposes a new technology perspective of the Metaverse and will provide further guidance for its technology development in the future. © 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Metaverse, Technical framework, Ubiquitous connections, Space convergence, Virtuality and reality interaction, Human-centered communication"
Evaluation of Metaverse integration of freight fluidity measurement alternatives using fuzzy Dombi EDAS model,"Developments in transportation systems, changes in consumerism trends, and conditions such as COVID-19 have increased both the demand and the load on freight transportation. Since various companies are transporting goods all over the world to evaluate the sustainability, speed, and resiliency of freight transportation systems, data and freight fluidity measurement systems are needed. In this study, an integrated decision-making model is proposed to advantage prioritize the freight fluidity measurement alternatives. The proposed model is composed of two main stages. In the first stage, the Dombi norms based Logarithmic Methodology of Additive Weights (LMAW) is used to find the weights of criteria. In the second phase, an extended Evaluation based on the Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method with Dombi unction for aggregation is presented to determine the final ranking results of alternatives. Three freight fluidity measurement alternatives are proposed, namely doing nothing, integrating freight activities into Metaverse for measuring fluidity, and forming global governance of freight activities for measuring fluidity through available data. Thirteen criteria, which are grouped under four main aspects namely technology, governance, efficiency, and environmental sustainability, and a case study at which a ground framework is formed for the experts to evaluate the alternatives considering the criteria are used in the multi-criteria decision-making process. The results of the study indicate that integrating freight activities into Metaverse for measuring fluidity is the most advantageous alternative, whereas doing nothing is the least advantageous one.","Freight fluidity, Metaverse, Fuzzy sets, Dombi norms, Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)"
Privacy-preserved learning from non-i.i.d data in fog-assisted IoT: A federated learning approach,"With the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, smart cities comprise complex networks, including sensors, actuators, appliances, and cyber services. The complexity and heterogeneity of smart cities have become vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks, especially privacy-related attacks such as inference and data poisoning ones. Federated Learning (FL) has been regarded as a hopeful method to enable distributed learning with privacy-preserved intelligence in IoT applications. Even though the significance of developing privacy-preserving FL has drawn as a great research interest, the current research only concentrates on FL with independent identically distributed (i.i.d) data and few studies have addressed the non-i. i.d setting. FL is known to be vulnerable to Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) attacks, where an adversary can presume to act as a contributor participating in the training process to acquire the private data of other contributors. This paper proposes an innovative Privacy Protection-based Federated Deep Learning (PP-FDL) framework, which accomplishes data protection against privacy-related GAN attacks, along with high classification rates from non-i. i.d data. PP-FDL is designed to enable fog nodes to cooperate to train the FDL model in a way that ensures contributors have no access to the data of each other, where class probabilities are protected utilizing a private identifier generated for each class. The PP-FDL framework is evaluated for image classification using simple convolutional networks which are trained using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The empirical results have revealed that PF-DFL can achieve data protection and the framework outperforms the other three state-of-the-art models with 3%–8% as accuracy improvements.","Privacy preservation, Federated learning, Deep learning, Fog computing, Smart cities"
Real-time hand interaction and self-directed machine learning agents in immersive learning environments,"Integration of extended reality (XR) in education is becoming popular to transform the traditional classroom with immersive learning environments. The adoption of immersive learning is accelerating as an innovative approach for science and engineering subjects. With new powerful interaction techniques in XR and the latest developments in artificial intelligence, interactive and self-directed learning are becoming important. However, there is a lack of research exploring these emerging technologies research with kinesthetic learning or “hands-one learning' as a pedagogical approach using real-time hand interaction and agent-guided learning in immersive environments. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses machine learning agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in science and engineering education through real-time hand interaction in the virtual world. To implement the following approach, this paper uses a chemistry-related case study and presents a usability evaluation conducted with 15 expert reviewers and 2 subject experts. NASA task load index is used for cognitive workload measurement, and the technology acceptance model is used for measuring perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in the evaluations. The evaluation with expert reviewers proposed self-directed learning using trained agents can help in the end-user training in learning technical topics and controller-free hand interaction for kinesthetic tasks can improve hands-on learning motivation in virtual laboratories. This success points to a novel research area where agents embodied in an immersive environment using machine learning techniques can forge a new pedagogical approach where they can act as both teacher and assessor.","Mixed reality, Virtual reality, Extended reality, Technology enhanced learning, Immersive learning, XR, Learning technology"
Exploring mobility and transportation technology futures for people with ambulatory disabilities: A science fiction prototype,"Although a number of studies have explored science fiction prototyping as a method for new product development, no study has ever used the method to examine the mobility and transportation technology needs of people with disabilities. The current research created a science fiction prototype, based on expert opinion expressed during an imagination workshop, which the authors then presented to a sample of people with ambulatory disabilities. Through a conjoint analysis, the sample members delineated the elements of the prototype they regarded as most important. The participants considered personal mobility assistive technology (either an automated wheelchair or an exoskeleton) the most important, followed by personal automation (autonomous [driverless] vehicle or personal robot) and thirdly by personal assistance technologies (real-time response versus augmented metaverse planning systems). Outputs to the conjoint analysis were clustered and three categories of individual emerged (i) more innovatively minded people who occupied the first cluster and preferred an exoskeleton, a personal robot and a subscription to the metaverse, (ii) people who appeared to be less technologically inclined and preferred an automated wheelchair, an autonomous vehicle and a subscription to a real-time assistive system, and (iii) a group with members favouring an AV but with few other predilections.","Science fiction prototype, Mobility, Transport, Transportation self-efficacy, Ambulatory disability, Technology interest, Imagination workshop"
An integrated approach to Bayesian weight regulations and multitasking learning methods for generating emotion-based content in the metaverse,"This paper introduces an integrated model designed to analyze topics and sentiments in textual data simultaneously, recognizing their interdependence. By tackling challenges such as data scarcity, missing information, and biased distributions, the proposed model effectively captures the dynamic interactions between topics and sentiments within complex datasets. The method combines the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for detecting topic-related patterns with a revised Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to trace the emotional flow within contexts, leveraging the strengths of sequential data processing. These components are integrated within a Bayesian probability framework, modeling the conditional probabilities of sentences expressing specific sentiments and documents being associated with particular topics. The combined feature and state vectors from the CNN and revised RNN within this Bayesian setup enable precise classification and prediction of topics and sentiments. Furthermore, this paper explores innovative research avenues, including sentiment analysis in 3D virtual reality environments and the development of new algorithms that reflect content creation techniques in the metaverse, offering dynamic system construction. This integrated approach not only enhances data-driven decision-making but also unlocks new possibilities for advanced multi-text analysis.","Emotion-based Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Multitasking learning, Scarcity, Metaverse and generation"
Quantitative and qualitative analysis in urban morphology: systematic legacy and latest developments,"Urban morphology studies the physical forms of human settlements and how these change over time by the action of different processes and agents. The field of knowledge has developed several theories, concepts, and methods to describe and explain the phenomena at hands. As in many fields, urban morphology contains a few misconceptions. One of these is the idea that quantitative analysis is a feature of the present and the future, and qualitative analysis of the past. The paper addresses this fallacy. Our discussion of the main schools of thought in urban morphology and their influential researchers suggests that quantitative approaches are well rooted in it since at least the mid-twentieth century and that the dominance of quantitative or qualitative tools is subject to cycles, as it happens in other sciences. Demonstration of both statements leads to a focus on a line of approaches, historico-geographical, configurational, and lately morphometrics, which share a common interest in cross-cases regularities, hence practices of pattern recognition.","built environment, quantitative versus qualitative, town & city planning, urban form, urban morphology"
Design of an Intelligent Navigation System Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision Algorithms,"Traditional static guidance systems have problems such as poor interactivity and low path planning efficiency. This paper designs an intelligent guidance system to achieve efficient, accurate and personalized navigation services. This paper constructs an intelligent guidance system that integrates reinforcement learning and computer vision algorithms, and adopts a multi-level architecture: the perception layer collects environmental data, the data processing layer uses YOLO and semantic segmentation to extract features, the decision layer uses deep Q network (DQN) to plan and optimize the path, and the interaction layer provides intuitive navigation and user feedback mechanism. The system effectively solves the limitations of traditional guidance systems in complex environments and improves navigation efficiency and user experience. In terms of path planning efficiency, the average path planning time of the intelligent guidance system is shorter than that of the traditional system; in terms of path navigation accuracy, the average accuracy of the intelligent guidance system reaches 99.1%, which is much higher than the 95.2% of the traditional system. These data fully prove the effectiveness of the intelligent guidance system proposed in this paper in improving the quality of navigation services and user experience.","DQN, YOLO, intelligent guidance system, reward function"
Using Web3.0 to build trust in agent-based additive manufacturing systems,"Artificial Intelligent agent (AIgent) based manufacturing systems use peer-to-peer communications to broker work, collectively maintain operational capability, and collectively learn and improve manufacturing quality. They are proving themselves to be resilient and responsive to disruption and changes in demand – key tenets of future manufacturing systems. The research to-date has assumed trust amongst AIgents, which cannot be guaranteed in decentralised distributed systems. The ability to build trust is necessary for industrial AIgent manufacturing systems. This paper starts this journey by reporting a proof-of-concept demonstrator to achieve trust amongst firm and Machine AIgents using Web3.0 technologies. A discussion highlights three research challenges that need to be addressed by the community.","Agent-Based Manufacturing Systems, Web3.0, Trust, Artificial Intelligence"
Generative AI for decision-making: A multidisciplinary perspective,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping decision-making across multiple domains, including health, law, business, education, and tourism. This study synthesizes the fragmented research on GenAI to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding its role in enhancing decision-making accuracy, efficiency, and personalization. Employing a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, this study categorizes diverse applications, from clinical diagnostics and legal reasoning to financial advisement and educational support, highlighting both innovative practices and persistent challenges. The analysis of 101 articles reveals that, while GenAI significantly improves data processing and decision support, mitigating issues such as inherent bias, misinformation, and transparency deficits requires careful attention. The integration of multi-agent frameworks and human oversight is critical for ensuring ethical and reliable outcomes. Ultimately, this synthesis highlights the transformative potential of GenAI as a decision-making tool by presenting a cross-disciplinary framework that reveals its impact and uncovers gaps across various domains. The study also advocates the development of robust regulatory and technological strategies to harness the benefits and address the limitations of GenAI.","GenAI, Decisions making, Health, Responsible AI, Ethical governance"
Pivotal role of digital twins in the metaverse: A review,"The ascent of the metaverse signifies a profound transformation in our digital landscape, ushering in a complex network of interlinked virtual domains and digital spaces. In this burgeoning metaverse, a paradigm shift is seen in how people engage, collaborate, and become immersed in digital environments. An especially intriguing concept taking root within this metaverse landscape is that of digital twins. Initially rooted in industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts, digital twins are now making their mark in the metaverse, presenting opportunities to elevate user experiences, introduce novel dimensions of interaction, and seamlessly bridge the divide between the virtual and physical realms. Digital twins, conceived initially to replicate physical entities in real-time, have transcended their industrial origins in this new metaverse context. They no longer solely replicate physical objects but extend their domain to encompass digital entities, avatars, virtual environments, and users. Despite the vital contributions of digital twins in the metaverse, there has been no research that has explored the applications and scope of digital twins in the metaverse comprehensively. However, there are a few papers focusing on some particular applications. Addressing this research gap, we present an in-depth review of the pivotal role of application digital twins in the metaverse. We present 15 digital twin applications in the metaverse, ranging from simulation and training to emergency preparedness. This study outlines the critical limitations of integrating digital twins and metaverse and several future research directions.","Digital twins, Metaverse, Applications, User experience, Limitations"
Enhanced digital twins (EDTs) approach based on advanced inspection and technology adoption to achieve sustainable construction processes,"The current trend in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry is undergoing digitalisation rapidly, meeting the requirements of sustainability while increasing efficiency, reducing costs and improving decision-making. This transformation is based on the connection between the physical environment and the virtual digital systems. However, Digital Twins (DTs) can represent this connection, and despite its importance, currently DTs are hindered by several challenges related to the accuracy of data, long workflows and fragmented digital ecosystems. To this end, this study proposes an innovative approach, “Enhanced Digital Twin (EDT)”, to overcome the traditional DTs’ limitations. To achieve this, a scientometric review is conducted based on quantitative mixed methods using VOSviewer and RStudio to analyse the collected database from Scopus of 342 peer-reviewed journal articles from 2020 to 2024. This was further supported through the analysis of similar applied case studies of relevant literature based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Findings represent that EDT can offer advantages through three main categories: construction, building and human aspects. The article also outlines future research directions and highlights some key benefits and challenges. Also, this article contributes originally to the existing body of knowledge by bridging the gap between digital technology and sustainable practices through proposing a holistic framework for SDGs-based EDT in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The latter supports the implementation of the EDT, reaching the SDGs, and the engagement of stakeholders in all phases of the building life cycle.","Digital twin, Inspection, Technology, Life cycle, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), Enhanced Digital Twin (EDT)"
Towards a data fabric framework for industrial metaverse integration,"The integration of digital and physical assets in industrial settings is increasingly facilitated by the concept of the Industrial Metaverse, a unified platform that leverages advanced technologies like AR/VR/XR to create interconnected 3D environments. As industries within supply chains become more interlinked, the need for seamless integration across these digital environments becomes critical. This paper addresses the challenge of interconnecting private industrial metaverses by proposing a novel data fabric framework that supports diverse modalities, ensures privacy, and adheres to business agreements. We highlight the role of the distributed compute continuum in the framework and demonstrate its practical utility through deployments in Unity and Omniverse across various geographic locations, highlighting the need for AI-based interconnection to optimize real-time analytics and operational scalability. Our experiment shows that even transmitting a 3D patch file, which is considerably smaller than the original base file, across metaverses in different geographic locations requires substantial computational and communication resources, potentially limiting real-time collaboration between metaverses. This observation highlights the importance of AI-based interconnection in enabling a textual metaverse, where instead of transmitting 3D patch objects over the web, only a fine-grained textual description of the patch file is shared. This method allows for more efficient transmission using current networking technology. The textual metaverse is expected to employ an AI-based encoder at the source and an AI-based decoder at the destination to convert the 3D patch into text and subsequently reconstruct it back into the 3D patch.","Distributed computing continuum, Metaverse, Internet of Things, Data fabric, Industrial metaverse, 3D virtual environment, AI interconnection, Complex Event Processing, Supply chain network"
Incorporating stochasticity in demands for optimizing resource allocation in versatile edge systems devoid of layer constraints,"While stochastic demand models have been introduced to better capture resource fluctuations, each instance of problem under different architectures needs to be analyzed and solved separately with duplicated work, this limitation motivates research to develop a scalable and adaptive resource scheduling solution capable of handling edge systems with any number of layers. Fortunately, we found that this kind of stochastic scheduling problem combined with sharing has an invariant optimal substructure that is independent of the number of layers, and propose the Placement of Resource in Any layer Edge architecture (PRAE) algorithm. We find an efficient way to solve it by splitting it into multiple subproblem groups and characterizing the relationship between these subproblems as an isomorphic network. We then identify optimal conditions for subproblem groups at different layers, and quickly achieve a solution using dynamic programming. Extensive evaluations show that PRAE improves resource utilization by over 28% compared to average demand models and achieves over 98% of optimal performance across diverse scenarios, with significantly lower computational complexity.","Edge architecture, Layer limit, Layer independent solution, Stochastic demand, Isomorphic network"
Toward Human Digital Twins for Cybersecurity Simulations on the Metaverse: Ontological and Network Science Approach,"Background Cyber defense is reactive and slow. On average, the time-to-remedy is hundreds of times larger than the time-to-compromise. In response, Human Digital Twins (HDTs) offer the capability of running massive simulations across multiple domains on the Metaverse. Simulated results may predict adversaries' behaviors and tactics, leading to more proactive cyber defense strategies. However, current HDTs’ cognitive architectures are underdeveloped for such use. Objective This paper aims to make a case for extending the current digital cognitive architectures as the first step toward more robust HDTs that are suitable for realistic Metaverse cybersecurity simulations. Methods This study formally documented 108 psychology constructs and thousands of related paths based on 20 time-tested psychology theories, all of which were packaged as Cybonto—a novel ontology. Then, this study applied 20 network science centrality algorithms in ranking the Cybonto psychology constructs by their influences. Results Out of 108 psychology constructs, the top 10 are Behavior, Arousal, Goals, Perception, Self-efficacy, Circumstances, Evaluating, Behavior-Controllability, Knowledge, and Intentional Modality. In this list, only Behaviors, Goals, Perception, Evaluating, and Knowledge are parts of existing digital cognitive architectures. Notably, some of the constructs are not explicitly implemented. Early usability tests demonstrate that Cybonto can also be useful for immediate uses such as manual analysis of hackers’ behaviors and automatic analysis of behavioral cybersecurity knowledge texts. Conclusions The results call for specific extensions of current digital cognitive architectures such as explicitly implementing more refined structures of Long-term Memory and Perception, placing a stronger focus on noncognitive yet influential constructs such as Arousal, and creating new capabilities for simulating, reasoning about, and selecting circumstances.","human behavior modeling, cognitive twins, human digital twins, cybersecurity, cognitive systems, digital twins, Metaverse, artificial intelligence"
A framework for efficient cross-chain token transfers in blockchain networks,"The proliferation of blockchain technology has resulted in diverse token standards, posing challenges for compatibility, security, and performance in existing cross-chain bridges. This paper introduces a novel framework capable of concurrently facilitating fungible token exchange, as well as the processing of both individual and batch non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We deploy token bridges that meet different token standards to support cross-chain staking and unlocking of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155. To minimize both waiting times and handling fees, we relocate processes necessitating frequent transactions and verifications to the sidechain. Additionally, we adopt a batch-processing approach for tokens necessitating cross-chain transfers, leveraging payment channels to facilitate efficiency. The system’s reliability is upheld through the validator group. Validators acquire an initial reputation value by making deposits and enhance both their rewards and reputation by successfully completing NFT auction tasks on the sidechain. We use OpenZeppelin’s security library functions to standardize token operations, and carefully design the validator’s reward, punishment, and reputation mechanisms. Our comprehensive contract security audit and system analysis validate our solution’s effectiveness in mitigating common vulnerabilities and internal threats. Implementation and testing with Ethereum and its test network demonstrate substantial reductions in transmission time for key cross-chain token steps by nearly half. Moreover, our framework showcases efficiency and cost-effectiveness with an average gas cost of 693,379.","Blockchain technology, Token bridge, Cross-chain interoperability, Payment channel, Token standards"
Tracing the evolution of the marketing discipline through the lens of theory and Practice: A journal-centric view,"The goal of this article is two-fold: (a) trace the evolution of marketing vis-à-vis theory and practice, and (b) investigate the relative contribution of the Journal of Business Research (JBR) to this evolution vis-à-vis the top 10 marketing journals. To do this, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of articles published in JBR between 2014 and 2024 (April). For the same period, we compare the performance of JBR with that of the top ten marketing journals. Our analysis allows us to (a) extend the contributions of Kerin (1996) and Kumar (2015) in tracing the evolution of marketing by identifying the predominant metaphor of the current phase of marketing as “marketing as an intelligent agent”, (b) identify prominent areas and clusters of marketing for JBR and the top ten marketing journals, (c) recognize JBR’s approach to the nature and type of theories used in its articles, and its approach in the use of special issues as its key contributions to the evolution of marketing, and (d) ascertain that JBR’s geographic distribution of the author affiliations, its higher tolerance to newer topics, and its higher level of risk appetite in its editorial choices are critical in determining how and why JBR differs in its evolution compared to the top ten marketing journals. We conclude by discussing the study’s implications on the future of the discipline and offer a research agenda.","Marketing theory, Marketing practice, Marketing evolution, Bibliometrics, Performance analysis, Science mapping"
"An overview of Web3 technology: Infrastructure, applications, and popularity","Web3, the next generation of the Internet, represents a decentralized and democratized web. Although it has garnered significant public interest and found numerous real-world applications, there is a limited understanding of people's perceptions and experiences with Web3. In this study, we conducted an empirical study to investigate the categories of Web3 applications and their popularity, as well as the potential challenges and opportunities within this emerging landscape. Our research was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, we analyzed 200 popular Web3 projects associated with 10 leading Web3 venture capital firms. In the second phase, we collected and examined code-related data from GitHub and market-related data from blockchain browsers (e.g., Etherscan) for these projects. Our analysis revealed that the Web3 ecosystem can be categorized into two groups, i.e., Web3 infrastructure and Web3 applications, with each consisting of several subcategories or subdomains. We also gained insights into the popularity of these Web3 projects at both the code and market levels and pointed out the challenges in the Web3 ecosystem at the system, developer, and user levels, as well as the opportunities it presents. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Web3 for researchers and developers, which in turn promotes further exploration and advancement in this innovative field.","Web3, Blockchain, Empirical study, Survey"
Utopian or dystopian? The portrayal of the metaverse in popular news on social media,"The metaverse has sparked lots of interest worldwide as many giant tech companies are pursuing this futuristic idea. However, it has not been properly studied empirically by social science scholars yet. Considering the vital role played by media frames in affecting people's attitudes and behaviors towards the technology, this study examined the framing of the metaverse in popular news across Social Network Sites (SNSs) by cluster analyzing Entman's four operational frame elements. It identified five frames: economic prospect frame, unwanted future frame, consumer prospect frame, threatening future frame, and probable future frame. Overall, findings suggest a polarized framing of the metaverse on social media. While the majority of voices about the metaverse are optimistic, there is also a strong negative and dystopian perspective in more than one third of the SNS news. This positive or negative one-sided framing of the metaverse on SNSs may therefore fragmentize and polarize the audience, rather than informing in a balanced way. Implications for future research are discussed.","Metaverse, Media framing, Technology framing, Technology communication, Technology journalism, Hierarchy cluster analysis"
Non-fungible token-enabled entrepreneurship: A conceptual framework,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the world by storm. Initially started as an art/game experiment, the NFT has given rise to a new form of entrepreneurship in the virtual world with massive opportunities and affordances. However, research into the entrepreneurial aspect of NFTs and the role of agency in the process is limited. In this article, I examine the concept of NFT-enabled Entrepreneurship (or NFTE). I first identify the main characteristics of NFTs, then define NFTE and discuss the related assumptions, and finally propose a conceptual framework for NFTE and investigate its enablers. I conclude by proposing NFTE as a novel domain of entrepreneurship theory and practice with extensive new research opportunities, and the plausibility of using NFT as an alternative mode of knowledge production in which scholars become “NFT creators.”","Non-fungible token, NFT, Entrepreneurship, Virtual, Enabler"
Crafting user experiences in the metaverse: A design science study,"Metaverse(s) is often referred to as a phenomenon where multiple and interconnected immersive experiences exist in parallel. It is an emerging trend and has drawn keen attention from consumers, practitioners, and scholars in various disciplines. Metaverses are likely to generate new business opportunities for firms and enable the firms to develop unique consumer experiences. However, the current stream of literature needs to focus on articulating how these user experiences can be designed. By adopting a design science research methodology, this study examines the user experiences that can be rendered in the metaverses. The study is conducted in two phases. In the first phase, based on expert interviews, we identify four distinct forms of user experiences and the vital techno-functional blocks required to realize these experiences. In the second phase, we utilize the best-worst method to evaluate the significance of each technological block in creating different metaverse-enabled experiences. This study enhances the metaverse literature by introducing a pentagonal techno-functional framework and categorizing the metaverse-enabled user experiences across the dimensions of create-ability and transact-ability.","Metaverse, Virtual worlds, Design science research methodology, User experience"
AI sensation and engagement: Unpacking the sensory experience in human-AI interaction,"Given the limited studies on AI sensation and its impact on consumer emotional response and engagement, we investigate its impact to drive engagement. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we began with a qualitative phase consisting of 68 interviews (18 healthcare employees, 37 users of Wearable Health Devices, 7 AI developers, and 6 academics). Grounded in the theories of constructed emotion and the uncanny valley, as well as insights from the qualitative phase, we developed a robust model investigating the role of AI sensation on costumer emotional responses and engagement. This was followed by a survey of 557 healthcare employees. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS for descriptive statistics and reliability assessments, and AMOS for confirmatory factor analysis to validate the robustness of our measurement models. our findings show that AI sensation can drive customer subjective feeling state and AI affects. We also found empirical evidence that both can mediate the relationship between AI sensation, customer subjective feeling state, AI affects and activation engagement. Our findings can offer valuable understanding for managers and AI developers, underscoring the important role of AI sensation for driving engagement.","AI sensation, Activation engagement, Customer sensory experience, AI empathy, AI literacy"
Machines vs. humans: The evolving role of artificial intelligence in livestreaming e-commerce,"As the capability of artificial intelligence (AI) improves, online retailers are exploring AI-based agents to communicate with viewers in live streaming, which is referred to as AI stremer. However, it is unclear where, what, and when the implementation of AI stremer is more effective than human beings in live-streaming e-commerce. To explore the dynamic interrelationships and temporal evolution between AI and human streamers and viewer engagement, this study examined the evolving role of AI streamers in live-streaming e-commerce. We utilised the linear mixed model (LMM) and the time-varying effect model (TVEM) to examine whether AI and human streamers differ in both monetary and non-monetary engagement activities. Additionally, we investigated how these differences change over time and whether such changes are consistent across different consumption contexts. The dataset consists of 924,036 products from 21,190 live streaming shows in 123 live broadcasting rooms over a period of four months was used in this study. The results suggest that AI streamers can substitute for humans in monetary activities in the context of utilitarian consumption but not in hedonic consumption. However, the substitute effect of AI may gradually diminish over time. In addition, in a hedonic context, AI exhibits an increasing effect on viewer engagement over time.","AI, Consumption type, Viewer engagement, Live streaming e-commerce, TVEM"
"The impact of metaverse for business model innovation: A review, novel insights and research directions","Digital transformation is changing the way businesses operate. Emerging technologies have the ability to impact products, processes, value chains, networks, and business models. In this panorama, metaverse offers to businesses and consumers new ways to interact with each other, toward the establishment of new virtual and interconnected spaces. Although, business have rapidaly adopted metaverse technologies for several purposes, the metaverse research field is still in its infancy, and there is a lack of understanding of meanings, purposes, and opportunities. With the aim of providing an historical overview, this study examines the role of metaverse in business model innovation, unveiling the elements introduced by this emerging technology that can affect companies' business models, the changes that metaverse generates over time in value creation and value capture actions, and the sectors most involved in this transformation. A systematic literature review with a double layer of analysis was conducted (bibliometric and content analysis). Our results reveal that over time, metaverse generated three waves of impacts on companies' business models. For each wave, the actions of value creation and capture enabled by metaverse were identified and the sectors involved in this transformation over time were summarized. Results were discussed in order to debate the capability of metaverse to generate new actions of value creation according to radical, incremental, and exaptation paths of innovation and the consequent capability to capture value among several stakeholders. Salient research gaps emerged and future research directions were proposed.","Virtual technologies, Augmented reality, Virtual communities, Business strategies, Business innovation"
Breaking into the black box of consumers’ perceptions on metaverse commerce: An integrated model of UTAUT 2 and dual-factor theory,"The advent of the metaverse has unveiled new promises for the retailing industry, yet little empirical research has explored the factors influencing consumer adoption intention in this context. This study aims to fill this gap by employing an integrated model of UTAUT 2 - “The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2”, and Dual-factor Theory to investigate both barriers and enablers in metaverse commerce adoption. Using a sample size of 567 respondents, the data analysis method employed in this study is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results reveal the driving factors affecting consumer adoption intention in metaverse commerce. The study identifies perceived technological, regulatory, and cyber risks as significant barriers to consumer adoption intention in metaverse commerce. Conversely, the findings highlight the importance of performance and effort expectancy, perceived herd behaviour, hedonic motivation, and consumer innovativeness as key enablers driving consumer adoption intention in metaverse commerce. Interestingly, subjective norms were found to have an insignificant effect in this context. This research contributes to understanding consumer behaviour in the emerging field of metaverse commerce and provides valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers. The identified barriers and enablers can guide strategic decision-making, allowing businesses to address consumer concerns and capitalize on the factors that drive adoption intention in this novel environment. Future research avenues could explore additional factors and delve deeper into the dynamics of consumer behaviour within the metaverse.","Metaverse commerce, Metaverse, Dual-factor theory, UTAUT 2, regulatory uncertainty"
Exploring the affective and cognitive dimensions of customer stickiness in deepfake platforms through the theoretical lens of attachment,"This study aims to understand how deepfakes affect customer stickiness, which characterizes the degree of customer retention on an online retail platform like Metaverse. Metaverse retail platforms can offer deepfake marketing to give customers an innovative buying experience. The study, built on the attachment theory and socio-technological approach, empirically evaluated affective and cognitive responses from 278 metaverse platform users using structural equation modelling. The results show that the technology factors, namely synchronicity, vicarious expression, and security and privacy, impacted platform attachment. The social factor, deepfakes interaction, impacted emotional attachment to deepfakes. The other social factors, deepfakes' familiarity and reputation, did not affect emotional attachment to Deepfakes' content. This study advances the literature on attachment theory and offers practical recommendations for retailers intending to explore deepfake usage on metaverse platforms. Our study proposes strategies for enhancing customers' attachment to retail brands through deepfakes and emphasizes the critical factors influencing customer retention in the context of metaverse retail.","Deepfakes, Metaverse retail platform, Customer retention, Attachment theory, Customer stickiness, Socio-technological factors"
A robust control framework for multi-agent systems under Byzantine attacks using hybrid event-triggered techniques,"This paper addresses the shortcomings of existing leader-following consensus approaches in multi-agent systems, particularly their vulnerability to Byzantine attacks and inefficiencies in communication and control updates. Current methods often struggle to handle sensor and actuator disruptions from Byzantine agents and suffer from excessive controller updates, which lead to communication overhead and the potential for Zeno behavior. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Hybrid Dynamic Event-Triggered Mechanism (HDETM), designed to minimize unnecessary agent interaction and reduce the frequency of controller updates while maintaining system robustness. By employing regularization techniques that ensure a positive inter-event time, our approach eliminates the risk of Zeno behavior. Additionally, the framework integrates auxiliary variables to capture both flow and jump dynamics, and through Lyapunov consensus analysis, we establish L2 stability with finite gain, ensuring system resilience under Byzantine attacks.

"Neuroscience in business-to-business marketing research: A literature review, co-citation analysis and research agenda","Neuroscience has led the way in bridging the gap between the social and natural sciences. The ongoing transformations in the business landscape have brought human-machine interaction and multi-agent systems to the forefront. This underscores the importance of theories that bridge the gap between human brain processes and business-to-business marketing practices. Despite the potential of neuroscience in business-to-business marketing, such interdisciplinary research is extensively lacking. This paper employs systematic literature reviews and co-citation analyses to: a) establish the absence of business-to-business marketing–neuroscience research; b) investigate the ways in which the broader business and management discipline has bridged with neuroscience to inspire such integration between business-to-business marketing and neuroscience; c) describe bridging approaches; and d) propose a research agenda for business-to-business marketing. The co-citation analyses show that the business and management discipline has focused on the ‘within-brain’ or behavioural aspects of neuroscience. In addition, the discipline has continually integrated new neuroscience insights or increasingly developed theories that are internalised within the discipline, independent of neuroscience. The paper's main contributions are the reviews and co-citation analyses, as well as an account of bridging in interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, the proposed research agenda enhances our understanding of the potential of neuroscience in business-to-business marketing.","Artificial intelligence, Business-to-business marketing, Co-citation analysis, Neuroscience, Research agenda, Systematic review"
Towards parallel Metaverse: symbiosis of physical and virtual worlds based on Cybertwin-enabled 6G,"Metaverse, envisioned as the next evolution of the Internet, is expected to evolve into an innovative medium advancing information civilization. Its core characteristics, including ubiquity, seamlessness, immersion, interoperability and metaspatiotemporality, are catalyzing the development of multiple technologies and fostering a convergence between the physical and virtual worlds. Despite its potential, the critical concept of symbiosis, which involves the synchronous generation and management of virtuality from reality and serves as the cornerstone of this convergence, is often overlooked. Additionally, cumbersome service designs, stemming from the intricate interplay of various technologies and inefficient resource utilization, are impeding an ideal Metaverse ecosystem. To address these challenges, we propose a bi-model Parallel Symbiotic Metaverse (PSM) system, engineered with a Cybertwin-enabled 6G framework where Cybertwins mirror Sensing Devices (SDs) and serve a bridging role as autonomous agents. Based on this framework, the system is structured into two models. In the queue model, SDs capture environmental data that Cybertwins then coordinate and schedule. In the service model, Cybertwins manage service requests and collaborate with SDs to make responsive decisions. We incorporate two algorithms to address resource scheduling and virtual service responses, showcasing the synergistic role of Cybertwins. Moreover, our PSM system advocates for the participation of SDs from collaborators, enhancing performance while reducing operational costs for Virtual Service Operator (VSO). Finally, we comparatively analyze the efficiency and complexity of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the efficacy of the PSM system across multiple performance indicators. The results indicate our system can be deployed cost-effectively with Cybertwin-enabled 6G.","Metaverse, Cybertwin-enabled 6G, Internet of Things (IoT), Multiple-access Edge Computing (MEC), Symbiosis of physical and virtual worlds"
"Conceptual and formal models for design, adaptation, and control of digital twins in supply chain ecosystems","The design and adaptation of digital twins in supply chains are of high relevance for academia and industry alike. While numerous prototype-based use cases have been reported, the literature lacks studies revealing generalizable methodological principles. This paper elaborates on conceptual and formal models of digital twins in the supply chain. First, we define a new notion named digital supply chain ecosystem extending the recently developed intelligent digital twin framework. A digital ecosystem is a set of digital technologies, AI-based knowledge management systems, cloud spaces, and platforms that encapsulate supply chain data enabling digital twins and simulation models. Second, we elaborate on a digital twin as a complex phenomenon comprising systems, technological-organizational models, and management decision-making support perspectives. We offer a dynamic, quantitative framework for digital twins as a decision-making support and modeling environment using control theory. Third, we introduce two views of building and adapting digital twins, i.e., object-driven and data-driven approaches. Their principle schemes are defined and discussed. Finally, we outline a generalized framework of the cyber-physical supply chain comprised of a digital ecosystem, digital twin, human-AI collaboration space, and the physical supply chain. Application scenarios are considered, e.g., using digital twins for stress testing of supply chain resilience in the setting of tariff-driven shocks as well as building resilient and viable agricultural ecosystems.","Supply chain, Digital twin, Digital ecosystem, Cyber-physical, Artificial intelligence, Simulation, Resilience"
Responsible metaverse: Ethical metaverse principles for guiding decision-making and maintaining complex relationships for businesses in 3D virtual spaces,"A metaverse is a three-dimensional virtual space (3D VS) where businesses and individuals worldwide can engage, interact, communicate, transact, and exchange information in real-time through an immersive and collaborative platform. These interactions can create complex relationships influenced by the decision-making processes of businesses. Such complexity can lead to challenges in maintaining relationships, ensuring exclusiveness, preventing misuse, and addressing other ethical issues. Therefore, this study aims to identify ethical principles within the metaverse to guide decision-making and maintain complex relationships between users and businesses. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected for analysis, and simple random sampling was employed for primary data collection. The empirical analysis was conducted using a mixed-method approach. The study identified four ethical principles that guide complex relationships within the metaverse: business benefit evaluation, fairness, explainability, and reliability principles. These principles positively influence decision-making, which, in turn, positively affects the maintenance of complex relationships within 3D VS.","Metaverse, Responsible metaverse, Ethical decision-making, Ethical principles, 3D virtual spaces, Complex relationships"
Cyber secure consensus of fractional order multi-agent systems with distributed delays: Defense strategy against denial-of-service attacks,"Leader-follower cyber secure consensus problem in cybersecurity is crucial as it directly addresses the need for secure and stable communication in a networked system, which is paramount in safeguarding against cyber threats like denial-of-service attacks. In this article, by utilizing control strategy with distributed delays in denial-of-service attack's presence for discrete-time multi-agent system of fractional-order, the leader-following cyber secure consensus problem is examined. Nonlinear functions have been assumed in the leader and follower equation of the system to study variations due to this function in the system. As multi-agent system is networked environment, in response to numerous threats, their security control becomes critically desirable, for example, denial of service. The consensus performance may be destabilized by resulting topologies which are caused by Denial-of-Service attacks. The connectivity between agents is destroyed, especially under connectivity-broken attacks. In order to overcome these problems, the strategy of novel defense which consists of consensus (with distributed delays) control is introduced. By using Caputo fractional difference operator sufficient criteria which includes the condition in terms LMI is derived and by using Lyapunov function approach, average dwell time and algebraic graph theory for security of addressed system's cyber secure consensus this is done for determining the obtained system of error's stability. Finally, by showing some numerical examples on the introduced systems, the effectiveness of the obtained results is determined.","Denial-of-service attacks, Distributed control, Caputo fractional difference operator, Multi-agent systems"
Sensing the Metaverse: The microfoundations of complementor firms' dynamic sensing capabilities in emerging-technology ecosystems,"Dynamic capabilities allow firms to adapt to rapidly changing environments, such as digital business ecosystems (DBEs) based on emerging technologies. Here, non-focal firms face specific challenges, since they have little leverage over the ecosystems in which they operate. In the case of the metaverse – which can be conceptualised as a series of emerging-technology-based DBEs – dynamic sensing capabilities (DSCs) are particularly important for grasping this potentially vast albeit vague opportunity. Our explorative study of 14 virtual reality companies operating in Germany operationalises the microfoundations of these DSCs. Based on 25 interviews with commercial and technical top management executives, we introduce taxonomic differentiation and explore the impact of size/resource base and business model/market type (B2B/B2C) on DSCs. We find that productive opportunism and bricolage behaviour allow non-focal firms to navigate the sheer complexity of the environment. Social screening helps to unlock tacit knowledge as do knowledge-creating routines such as technical experimentation and co-creation (with customers, suppliers and even competitors). Furthermore, our findings enlarge the understanding of DBEs as not horizontally competing but as being organised in a downstream–upstream relationship. Moreover, we find that (commercially oriented) opportunity screening is closely and crucially linked with dynamic seizing capabilities (e.g. customer-driven prototyping and business model development).","Digital business ecosystem, Dynamic capabilities, Sensing, Metaverse, Platform, Complementor"
Making (common) sense of Urban Digital Twins with Q methodology,"Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) serve as boundary objects, facilitating interactions among diverse actor-networks within an innovation ecosystem. The concept of UDTs exhibits ‘interpretative flexibility’, allowing policymakers, technologists, urban planners and citizens to impose their values, needs and expectations onto the technology while sustaining a shared understanding of its potential. A key question arises: how can perspectives on UDTs within these actor-networks be identified and guide future innovation? Using the Q methodology for ‘boundary spanning’, the authors investigated the range of perspectives on UDTs and their influence on shaping regional innovation strategies. The research included some intervention-oriented aims and engaged 29 participants from governmental, industrial, and academic sectors involved in UDT initiatives in a regional urban network in the Netherlands. In interviews, participants completed a card-sorting task, ranking 41 statements that addressed five critical dimensions: Terminology, Values, Impact, Innovation and Strategy. The analysis revealed three dominant perspectives: (1) Strategic Confidence in UDTs; (2) Cautious Critique of UDTs; and (3) Technological Pragmatism for UDTs. The findings from this Q study fostered a better understanding of the UDT perspectives and cross-sector collaboration in the urban network, leading to more dynamic and adaptive UDT strategies.","Boundary object, Boundary spanning, Regional innovation, Spatial development, Social construction of technology, Urban Digital Twin, Q methodology"
A user-centric taxonomy of cyber harm in the metaverse,"This paper proposes a user-centric taxonomy of cyber harm for use in development of a metaverse-oriented harm prevention approach for children. This contrasts with extant models of cyber harm which consider harm from an organisational perspective, with an eye to business impact. The taxonomy is a synthesis resulting from analyses of Australian legislation, the IEEE 3527.1 international standard, term definitions given in law and psychology dictionaries, specific government provisions, and peer-reviewed literature. It comprises a list of harmful or potentially harmful behaviours, each of which serves as a parent category for different types of harmful scenarios. An iterative approach to analysis was employed to develop the taxonomy, which was then tested through a review of scholarly literature.","Metaverse, Online risk, User awareness, Cyber harm prevention, Taxonomy, e-safety"

Securing consensus in fractional-order multi-agent systems: Algebraic approaches against Byzantine attacks,"This paper investigates the behavior of fractional-order nonlinear multi-agent systems subjected to Byzantine assaults, specifically focusing on the manipulations of both sensors and actuators. We employ weighted graphs, both directed and undirected, to illustrate the system's topology. Our methodology combines algebraic graph theory with fractional-order Lyapunov techniques to develop algebraic requirements for leader-following consensus, providing a robust framework for analyzing consensus dynamics in these complex systems. We present quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach, including two numerical examples that validate the proposed requirements for consensus evaluation. Notably, our work highlights the novelty of using fractional-order systems to enhance resilience against adversarial conditions, contributing significantly to the field of multi-agent systems. By clarifying key terms and streamlining our language, we ensure accessibility for a broader audience while emphasizing the implications of our findings for real-world applications.","Fractional-order systems, Nonlinear dynamics, Byzantine attacks, Leader-following consensus, Fractional-order Lyapunov approach"
The dark side of the metaverse: The role of gamification in event virtualization,"The virtualization of cultural events in the metaverse creates opportunities to generate valuable and innovative experiences that replicate and extend in-person events; but the process faces associated challenges. In the absence of relevant empirical studies, the aim of this article is to analyze the positive and negative aspects of the user experience in a cultural event held in the metaverse. A mixed-methods approach is employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results from three focus groups demonstrated the difficulty that users face in focusing their attention on the main elements of the metaverse, and the inability of this virtual sphere to convey the authenticity of a cultural event. Based on these findings, a metaverse-focused quantitative study was conducted to examine whether perceived gamification mitigate the negative effects of users failing to pay attention in their metaverse experiences. When users increased their attention levels, their ability to imagine the real experience and their perceptions of the authenticity of the cultural event increased, which produced positive behavioral intentions. This is one of the first studies to empirically analyze the tourist experience in the metaverse; managers and policymakers can benefit from the results to hold valuable virtual cultural events.","Authenticity, Events industry, Metaverse, Selective attention theory, Virtualization"
Unveiling virtual interactive marketplaces: Shopping motivations in the Metaverse through the lens of uses and gratifications theory,"The emergence of Metaverse has transformed the consumer shopping experience. This novel e-commerce platform offers a fresh approach to shopping, with Generation Z primarily exploring this innovative technology. Our research examines shopping within the Metaverse by developing a model based on the ’Uses and Gratifications Theory’ and Metaverse-related factors. A total of 1220 Gen Z consumers were surveyed, and data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Further, analysis of collected data was done using PLS-SEM. The results reveal that information seeking, perceived enjoyment, escapism, social interaction, sense of immersion, and personalization influence the shopping intention in the Metaverse, and perceived risk negatively influences the shopping intention of consumers. Further, shopping intention influences the potential use of Metaverse for shopping, and this relationship is moderated by technological innovativeness. This investigation into the adoption of the Metaverse for retail purposes augments the current Metaverse research and enhances the uses and gratifications theory within the Metaverse domain. Metaverse e-commerce professionals, including managers and developers, can acquire valuable perspectives on consumer shopping tendencies in the Metaverse from this study.","Uses and gratifications, Metaverse shopping, Personalization, PLS-SEM, Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA)"
"Digital transition, data-and-tasks crowd-based economy, and the shared social progress: Unveiling a new political economy from a European perspective","The current unequal distribution of the benefits of digital transition and data-and-tasks crowd-based economy is directly linked to an incomplete interpretation of the behaviour of economic agents and their effects. This article proposes a new economic vision of digitalisation based on overcoming the postulates of neoclassical (automation-oriented and implemented mainly in the US) and autocratic (control-oriented and implemented mainly in China) economics. It suggests recovering the evolutionary, social, institutional, ethical and humanistic precepts of political economy. Following this more plural and European conceptual orientation, the analysis shows that current inequality arises from a digital R&D&I process plagued by network, platform, bias and polarisation effects, from business models that foster automation, and from the emergence of large superstar firms or control organisations with excessive market and political power. The redirection of technological progress towards more democratic individual values and shared social welfare requires digital governance based on new incentives and taxes, a greater strategic and political orientation towards social sustainability, and a new transformative role for the State.","Digital transition, Prediction value, Circulation value, Data-and-tasks crowd-based economy, Digital governance, Political economy"

Decentralised Identity Management solution for zero-trust multi-domain Computing Continuum frameworks,"The adoption of the Computing Continuum is characterised by the seamless integration of diverse computing environments and devices. In this dynamic landscape, sharing resources across the continuum is becoming a reality and security must move an step forward, specially in terms of authentication and authorisation for such a distributed and heterogeneous environments. The need for robust identity management is paramount and, in this regard, Decentralised Identity Management (DIM) emerges as a promising solution. It leverages decentralised technologies to secure and facilitate identity interactions across the Computing Continuum. Particularly, to enhance security and privacy, it would be desirable to apply the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). In this paradigm, users have full ownership and control of their digital identities that empowers individuals to manage and share their identity data on a need-to-know basis. These mechanisms could contribute to improve security properties during continuum resource management operations. In this context, this paper presents the design, workflows and implementation of a solution that provides authentication/authorisation features to distributed zero-trust based infrastructures across the continuum, enhancing security in resource sharing and resource acquisition stages. To this aim, the solution relies on key aspects like decentralisation, interoperability, trust management and privacy-enhancing capabilities. The decentralisation leverages distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain, to establish a decentralised identity ecosystem. The solution prioritises interoperability, enabling nodes to seamlessly access and share their identities across different domains and environments. Trustworthiness is at the core of DIM, and privacy is also considered, incorporating privacy-preserving techniques that individuals to selectively disclose identity attributes while safeguarding sensitive information. The implementation includes different operations for allowing continuum frameworks to be enhanced with decentralised authentication and authorisation features. The performance has been evaluated measuring the impact for the adoption of the solution. The most expensive task, the self-identity generation, takes only a few seconds (in our deployment) and it is only executed once. Authorisation tasks operate in the millisecond range, which is a totally invaluable time if incorporated into resource acquisition processes in frameworks such as Liqo, used in the scope of FLUIDOS project.","Identity management, Computing Continuum, DID, Verifiable credentials, DLT, Zero trust"
Physical and digital worlds: implications and opportunities of the metaverse,"The Metaverse is revolutionizing the world of the internet. It is the new “virtual” universe capable of going beyond the pure three-dimensional and immersive dimension combining the physical and digital worlds. The metaverse, which until recently was an abstract concept, is now assuming great importance and attracting the attention of consumers, investors, brands, and large global players. Certainly, the first sector to adapt to this new immersive reality is e-commerce. Obviously, e-commerce is not the only sector affected by this digital revolution. Interoperability and interconnection will revolutionize current business models. Although the business opportunities seem endless, the scenario is still not entirely clear. Thus, the aim of the present research is to provide an overview on the state of the art, technologies, applications, and challenges of metaverse. Ethical and social implications are also analized. The result is a first detailed scenario analysis on the Metaverse.","Metaverse, Immersive Internet, Multi-technology, Sociality, AR, VR"

A deep learning-orchestrated garlic routing architecture for secure telesurgery operations in healthcare 4.0,"Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted different real-time services, predominantly in the healthcare domain. One such real-time IoT-based application is telesurgery, where surgeons remotely transmit surgery instructions to a robotic arm, enabling it to conduct surgical procedures on patients. Since these surgical instructions use conventional wireless networks, they can leveraged by the attackers to manipulate them and manoeuvre the entire telesurgery application. Therefore, in this paper, we used emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), garlic routing (GR) networks, and blockchain, to propose an AI- and GR-based secure data instruction architecture for telesurgery applications in the healthcare 4.0 domain. A standard sensor dataset is utilized to train different AI algorithms, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU), for classifying malicious and non-malicious telesurgery data. Further, the non-malicious data is forwarded to the GR network that provides an end-to-end encrypted tunnel using ElGamal and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). ElGamal encryption encrypts the session tags for each telesurgery data relayed between surgeons and the robotic arm. The tags are stored in the immutable blockchain nodes to avoid data tampering attacks that strengthen the legitimacy of the garlic routers. Among both, the GRU outperforms with test accuracy 96.89%, precision 97.32%, recall 96.46%, F1 score 96.86%, and training loss 3%. Furthermore, the telesurgery data is transmitted via an AES-based outbound tunnel and received via an AES-based inbound tunnel, offering robust security against the security threats associated with the telesurgery application. To improve the network performance, we used essential characteristics (ultra-low latency, high speed, and high reliability) of the 5G network interface between each layer of the proposed architecture. The proposed architecture is evaluated using different evaluation metrics, such as statistical analysis (training accuracy, training loss, optimizer performance, activation function performance), data compromisation rate (0.346), network throughput (1.44 Mbps), error rate, and latency comparison.","Telesurgery, Healthcare 4.0, Smart healthcare system, Artificial intelligence, Onion routing, Garlic routing routing, Blockchain"
Event-triggered consensus control with dynamic agents and communication delays in heterogeneous multi-agent systems,"This paper investigates the consensus problem in discrete multi-agent systems characterized by both first-order and second-order agent dynamics, addressing the challenges posed by input delays and disturbances. To optimize data exchange and information sharing, an innovative event-triggered control system with communication delays is developed for the consensus control strategy. The materials employed in this study include a diverse set of heterogeneous agents designed to mirror real-world dynamics and delay characteristics. The methods involve the formulation of the consensus condition using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) and Kronecker product techniques, complemented by Lyapunov functional approaches for rigorous system stability analysis. The uniquely distributed control mechanism relies solely on local neighbor communication, enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework is validated through comprehensive simulations, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in achieving consensus among agents under the specified dynamic conditions.","Decentralized consensus, Heterogeneous agents, Lyapunov stability, Linear matrix inequality (LMI), Time communication delay and disturbances"
Harnessing the potential of generative AI in digital marketing using the Behavioral Reasoning Theory approach,"Generative AI (GAI) is an upcoming field and its impact on marketing is indisputable. Very little evidence in academic literature is present regarding the factors affecting the usage of GAI in Digital Marketing (DM). This study addresses this gap by exploring the key drivers and barriers associated with using GAI in DM. Leveraging Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), the research validates prior findings and introduces a conceptual model outlining factors that shape attitudes toward adopting GAI in DM to enhance customer experiences. A qualitative inductive approach was undertaken by conducting expert interviews to investigate the “reasons for” and ‘reasons against’ using GAI in DM and its impact on customer experience. The transcripts generated were manually coded and a deductive thematic analysis was done using the BRT as the theoretical framework. The findings indicate four significant themes for adopting GAI in digital marketing viz: innovation, creative communication and content creation, speed, efficiency and timesaving, enhanced customization and personalization; predictive analytics and simulation. It also indicates five significant themes related to the key barriers were also identified viz: ethics and infringement of Intellectual Property; security and deepfake; learning ecosystem for the adoption of new technology; quality of data; reduced manpower requirement. The study further highlights how GAI influences customer experience in DM. This study contributes to the field by (a) proposing a conceptual framework for applying GAI in DM to improve customer experiences, (b) examining the drivers and challenges of GAI adoption in DM, and (c) presenting a research agenda to guide future studies.

Distributed Meta-Learning for Context Based on Culture Heritage Collection Data in an Immersive Reality System,"This article proposes a new workflow for Culture Heritage (CH) Collection Data in which distributed meta-learning with context-based fusion is required. The multidisciplinary research outlines a new paradigm for collaborative creation of a context- based data fusion CH workflow. Whose criterion restricts the search space to the cultural sector to include multiple other CH object types, texts and predominantly analyzes visualizations of CH object metadata. The approach promotes user-driven content creation and offsets economic models, thereby rewarding creators and performers. In response to these challenges, we propose a framework for bringing about massive and real-time presence and awareness on the Internet through an Internet of Things infrastructure to connect objects, context and intangible assets. We enable an online virtual world that incorporates proximity of pervasive information, objects, people, processes, data and places. Finally, we investigate some new ways to achieve immersive experiences via distributed meta-learning computing and point out the necessity to do more with regard to collaborative interaction creation.","Distributed Data processing, Creative technologies, Distributed system, Immersive participation, IoT"
Developing scales for assessing metaverse characteristics and testing their utility,"Despite the rapidly growing scholarly and applied interest in the metaverse, inquiries concerning the defining features of the metaverse and the appropriate methodology for assessing these features remain unresolved. In order to address these inquiries, we executed two empirical investigations. In Study 1, we initially conceptualize the attributes of the metaverse and develop scales for assessing the metaverse characteristics. Subsequently, we evaluate the validity and reliability of this metric through the analysis of data acquired from 106 participants utilizing prominent metaverse platforms such as Zepeto, Roblox, and Ifland. In Study 2, we establish a theoretical model by associating metaverse characteristics with experiential value users perceive and appraising the construct's utility to account for an individual's continuance intention. The proposed model was tested through a sample of 218 metaverse users. The findings of Study 1 demonstrate that the metaverse is delineated by five factors: seamlessness, interoperability, concurrence, presence, and creator economy. The results of Study 2 reveal that, despite the creator economy being a legitimate attribute of the metaverse, its impact on a user's experiential value remains insignificant in the current metaverse platforms. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on the metaverse by developing scales and testing their utility. The outcomes are anticipated to yield practical insights for metaverse service providers on strategies for sustaining user engagement by leveraging the inherent attributes of the metaverse.","Metaverse, Metaverse characteristics, Scale development, Experiential value, Value-based adoption model"
SENEM: A software engineering-enabled educational metaverse,"Context: The term metaverse refers to a persistent, virtual, three-dimensional environment where individuals may communicate, engage, and collaborate. One of the most multifaceted and challenging use cases of the metaverse is education, where educators and learners may require multiple technical, social, psychological, and interaction instruments to accomplish their learning objectives. While the characteristics of the metaverse might nicely fit the problem’s needs, our research points out a noticeable lack of knowledge into (1) the specific requirements that an educational metaverse should actually fulfill to let educators and learners successfully interact towards their objectives and (2) how to design an appropriate educational metaverse for both educators and learners. Objective: In this paper, we aim to bridge this knowledge gap by proposing SENEM, a novel software engineering-enabled educational metaverse. We first elicit a set of functional requirements that an educational metaverse should fulfill. Method: In this respect, we conduct a literature survey to extract the currently available knowledge on the matter discussed by the research community, and afterward, we assess and complement such knowledge through semi-structured interviews with educators and learners. Upon completing the requirements elicitation stage, we then build our prototype implementation of SENEM, a metaverse that makes available to educators and learners the features identified in the previous stage. Finally, we evaluate the tool in terms of learnability, efficiency, and satisfaction through a Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation research approach, leading us to the iterative refinement of our prototype. Results: Through our survey strategy, we extracted nine requirements that guided the tool development that the study participants positively evaluated. Conclusion: Our study reveals that the target audience appreciates the elicited design strategy. Our work has the potential to form a solid contribution that other researchers can use as a basis for further improvements.","Metaverse engineering, Virtual learning environments, Human-centered studies, Software engineering in practice"
Suspicious trading in nonfungible tokens (NFTs),"This paper employs a three-pronged approach to examine price patterns in a substantial chunk of trades in nonfungible token (NFT) transactions to identify suspicious trading activities. Tests based on Benford's Law, clustering via Student's t-test, and Pareto–Levy analyses identify nonconformity. This potentially signals manipulation. Reapplying Benford's Law to a subset of 50 highly popular NFTs’ trading volumes, we observe adherence in first and second digits. To ensure robustness, we re-apply a χ2 test and the Mean Absolute Deviation statistic and notice that the principal findings accord with contemporary research on cryptocurrencies and certain asset classes in the traditional financial markets. Our findings constitute further evidence on the Wild Wild West nature of emerging digital asset markets and underscore the need for regulation to prevent market abuse and instill investor confidence.","Finance, NFT, Nonfungible token, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Manipulation, Wash trading, Benford's law"
A market management approach to transformative business operations,"How are new-age technologies transforming business operations? Why does it matter? The article suggests that a market management approach is conducive to understanding how new-age technologies can transform business operations. In this regard, the article defines market management approach as a holistic framework for managing transformative business operations that emphasizes the integration of emerging technologies with an organization’s operational processes. In this regard, the concept of transformative business operations is introduced and defined as the transformation of organizational systems, resources, and processes using new-age technologies to improve business functions that can generate superior value offerings to all stakeholders. The proposed transformative business operations approach identifies three triggers—the tension of uncertainty, adaptive capabilities, and operational elasticity—that drive the unique and synergistic impacts of these technologies. These triggers result in transformative changes through (a) foundational shifts in organizations, (b) strategy design, execution, and optimization, (c) unified ecosystem creation, and (d) pioneering business operations solutions.

"Metaverse beyond the hype: Multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy","The metaverse has the potential to extend the physical world using augmented and virtual reality technologies allowing users to seamlessly interact within real and simulated environments using avatars and holograms. Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda that is valuable for researchers, professionals and policy makers alike.","Avatars, Augmented reality, Extended reality, Metaverse, Second life, Virtual reality, Virtual world"

AI-Enabled Grouping Bridgehead to Secure Penetration Topics of Metaverse,"With the advent of the big data era, security issues in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and data analysis are attracting research attention. In the metaverse, which will become a virtual asset in the future, users’ communication, movement with characters, text elements, etc., are required to integrate the real and virtual. However, they can be exposed to threats. Particularly, various hacker threats exist. For example, users’ assets are exposed through notices and mail alerts regularly sent to users by operators. In the future, hacker threats will increase mainly due to naturally anonymous texts. Therefore, it is necessary to use the natural language processing technology of artificial intelligence, especially term frequency-inverse document frequency, word2vec, gated recurrent unit, recurrent neural network, and long-short term memory. Additionally, several application versions are used. Currently, research on tasks and performance for algorithm application is underway. We propose a grouping algorithm that focuses on securing various bridgehead strategies to secure topics for security and safety within the metaverse. The algorithm comprises three modules: extracting topics from attacks, managing dimensions, and performing grouping. Consequently, we create 24 topic-based models. Assuming normal and spam mail attacks to verify our algorithm, the accuracy of the previous application version was increased by ∼0.4%–1.5%.","Metaverse, security, computational linguistics, grouping bridgehead, AI"

This study delves into the emotions users experience in relation to their avatars and examines how this attachment influences their consumption behaviors within the virtual world. The research employed a sample of 214 active users participating in Second Life, a prominent virtual world platform. By analyzing survey data, we explore the dynamics of self-presentation and attachment between users and their virtual personas across this well-established platform. Our research offers valuable contributions to the existing literature on the Metaverse, providing empirical evidence on how virtual reality platforms like Second Life foster avatar customization and how this, in turn, affects consumer behavior. As the Metaverse gains prominence in the business world, understanding the habits and preferences of virtual reality users is increasingly crucial. We aim to enhance our understanding of consumer behavior by incorporating attachment theory into our research on long-standing virtual environments like Second Life. Our study of Second Life provides valuable insights into the dynamics of consumer behavior within a well-established virtual world, which can be applied to the emerging Metaverse platforms. This knowledge helps businesses identify consumer profiles, address their needs, and enhance their virtual presence and success.","Avatar, Attachment theory, Consumption, Metaverse, Virtual reality, Second life"
Analyzing the behaviors of pedestrians and cyclists in interactions with autonomous systems using controlled experiments: A literature review,"Urban transportation is set to undergo a profound transformation with the advent of autonomous systems such as autonomous vehicles, automated buses, and sidewalk delivery robots. To promote safe, sustainable, and inclusive urban mobility, understanding and predicting the behaviors of pedestrians and cyclists, including their intentions, decisions, and movements, when they interact with autonomous systems becomes crucial. Gaining a thorough understanding of these complex interactions can not only improve the safety, efficiency, and acceptance of autonomous systems but also enhance the design and implementation of these technologies. Through a comprehensive review of the literature spanning the years 2014 to 2023, we identify 99 articles that empirically investigate the interactions of humans and autonomous systems. Based on our overview of progress and challenges within this field, we further identify five research gaps that future research should address to enhance human-autonomous system interactions, including: (1) scaling up experimental scenarios to multi-user and multi-modal setups to better represent real-world challenges, (2) emphasizing safety-critical scenarios that are difficult to achieve in real-world environments by applying virtual reality, (3) incorporating diverse behavioral data from the human perspective to deepen the understanding of vulnerable road user behavior and decisions, (4) embracing continuous and real-time interaction to better predict dynamic future environments, and (5) enhancing the generalization ability to ensure realism and broad applicability. This review article offers valuable insights for the growing human-autonomous system research community, specifically those interested in leveraging controlled experiments to enhance the understanding and prediction of pedestrians' and cyclists' behaviors in future urban environments.","Human-autonomous system interaction, Human behavioral modeling, Autonomous vehicles, Virtual reality, Controlled experiment"

The dynamics of digital technology adoption in rainbow trout aquaculture: Exploring multi-stakeholder perceptions in Ontario using Q methodology and the theory of planned behaviour,"This paper explores the perspectives surrounding digital technology adoption in rainbow trout farming in Ontario, Canada. While digital transformation can help support and meet the growth needs of the fishery and aquaculture industries, few studies explore digital technology adoption in aquaculture and even fewer consider the diverse perspectives of various actors in this context. We aim to fill this gap by examining the viewpoints of key rainbow trout farming stakeholders, such as producers, researchers, and technology providers, regarding adopting digital technologies. This study, which is unique in the Ontario context, employed Q methodology to explore the perspectives of different actors using the extended theory of planned behaviour as a framework. We performed the Q-sort procedure using Qualtrics, providing 23 actors with 27 statements on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Q-factor analysis in PQ-method software identified three distinct discourses. Discourse 1 highlights skilled employees and data-related concerns, Discourse 2 emphasises understanding the complexity and costs associated with digital technologies, and Discourse 3 emphasises financial assistance and perceived value, focusing on attitude and perceived behavioural control. Interestingly, the three discourses were represented by various groups of actors, and not all respondents from the same sector shared the same perception. The findings of this study contribute to the limited scientific research on digital technology adoption in rainbow trout farming, which can inform strategic policy decisions.","Digital technology, Rainbow trout, Q method, Theory of planned behaviour, Ontario, Canada"
Metaverse crimes in virtual (Un)reality: Fraud and sexual offences under English law,"The technological evolution has not only opened new frontiers but has also become an indispensable part of our daily lives. However, the technology that enhances our lives presents a dual reality—it offers opportunities for criminals while creating challenges for law enforcement. Fraud, particularly, has become a pervasive issue. In response, virtual asset service providers must take measures to tackle cryptocurrency-related fraud. Nevertheless, this becomes challenging if the perpetrator exists solely within the virtual world. In 1992, Neal Stephenson used the term ‘Metaverse’ to describe a virtual world where people interact with each other using avatars. Over time, the Metaverse has transformed into a complex concept akin to 'cyberspace'. The Metaverse is a virtual environment that uses technologies to mimic the real world. As this virtual space became intertwined with financial transactions, especially through cryptocurrencies, the Metaverse evolved into a medium for perpetrating scams. Within this context, the article addresses the challenges associated with criminal activity in the Metaverse. Considering the potential applications of AI, cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens, three main challenges can be identified: 1) decentralisation, 2) anonymity of the user, and 3) lack of regulation. This article examines the applicability of existing legislation to regulate criminal activity in the Metaverse through doctrinal research. Using a comparative approach, it analyses the challenges of addressing virtual crimes by contrasting fraud (Fraud Act 2006) with sexual assault (Sexual Offences Act 2003), highlighting the complexity of addressing crimes involving physical contact in virtual spaces compared to financial crimes.","Metaverse, Crypto assets, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Fraud, Financial crime"
Satisfaction and performance expectations for the adoption of the metaverse in tourism SMEs,"The last decade has seen major transformations in the tourism sector, influenced by changes in consumer behaviour and the integration of technology. The Metaverse has emerged as a transformative force but with certain limitations. In this sense, the literature highlights the need to address research gaps in terms of the levels of acceptance of this new technology and with regard to the challenges faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the tourism sector. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to assess the adoption intention of high technology in tourism by small and medium-sized enterprises, focusing on the key role of the Metaverse as a new paradigm. For data collection, a total of 172 small and medium-sized enterprises have been surveyed using a double methodology, PLS-SEM and QCA, for the analysis. The results show that small and medium-sized tourism enterprises intend to adopt technologies associated with the Metaverse for the concept of Business Satisfaction rather than for the possible performance it may represent. These results represent an important advance in the understanding of the integration of Metaverse technologies in the tourism sector in this type of companies, where it can help to adopt diverse strategies in the business environment without having an excessive Resistance to Change, helping to be able to face it in conjunction with other capabilities.","Small and medium-sized companies, Tourism, Metaverse, Intention to use"
ENIGMA: An explainable digital twin security solution for cyber–physical systems,"Digital Twins (DTs), being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, share valuable knowledge of the underlying physical processes and act as data acquisition and dissemination sources to Cyber–Physical System (CPS). Moreover, without obstructing the ongoing operations, DTs also provide an assessment platform for evaluating the operational behavior and security of the CPS. Therefore, they become a potential source of data breaches and a broad attack surface for attackers to launch covert attacks. To detect and mitigate security loopholes in DTs, one of the potential solutions is to leverage a gamification approach that can assess the security level of DTs while providing security analysts with a controlled and supportive virtual training environment. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based approaches can complement the idea of security orchestration and automation in the gamification approach. However, AI/ML-based DTs security solutions are generally constrained by the lack of transparency of AI operations, which results in less confidence in the decisions made by the AI models. To address the explainable security challenges of DTs, this article proposes a gamification approach called sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA). While leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming scenarios to assess DTs’ security and train security analysts. The game players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI agents (the defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based DT security assessment model that explains the decisions made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack vectors for the defender team, i.e., the AI agent. The SHAP values illustrate the contribution of different features towards predicting the outcome of attack vectors. This explanation can help security analysts to take security measures based on reasoned and trustworthy decisions. Finally, experimental validation has been carried out to demonstrate the viability of ENIGMA.","Cyber-physical system (CPS), Cybersecurity awareness, Digital twins (DTs), eXplainable AI (XAI), Gamification, Industry 5.0"
Advancing Metaverse's experience through optimization of players’ decisions,"The Metaverse, a virtual world enabling user interaction with digital environments and assets, increasingly utilizes blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent unique characters and items. Representing and valuing individual digital characters is crucial in the Metaverse as it establishes ownership, identity, and status within these virtual worlds. This research investigates decision-making within collaborative online games, where players face the challenge of optimizing their character's value through strategic NFT acquisition. This challenge is analogous to the Knapsack Problem, aiming to maximize the value of items selected within a limited capacity, just as players seek to maximize character rarity within budget constraints. We propose a Decision Support System (DSS) employing genetic algorithms to assist players in tackling this complex optimization problem. A simulation framework, based on the 'SunflowerLand' Metaverse, demonstrates that players using the DSS achieve significantly higher character rarity, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance player experience.","Decision support systems, Metaverse, NFT, Genetic algorithm, Artificial intelligence, Blockchain"

Synthetic human gonadal tissues for toxicology,"The process of mammalian reproduction involves the development of fertile germ cells in the testis and ovary, supported by the surrounders. Fertilization leads to embryo development and ultimately the birth of offspring inheriting parental genome information. Any disruption in this process can result in disorders such as infertility and cancer. Chemical toxicity affecting the reproductive system and embryogenesis can impact birth rates, overall health, and fertility, highlighting the need for animal toxicity studies during drug development. However, the translation of animal data to human health remains challenging due to interspecies differences. In vitro culture systems offer a promising solution to bridge this gap, allowing the study of mammalian cells in an environment that mimics the physiology of the human body. Current advances on in vitro culture systems, such as organoids, enable the development of biomaterials that recapitulate the physiological state of reproductive organs. Application of these technologies to human gonadal cells would provide effective tools for drug screening and toxicity testing, and these models would be a powerful tool to study reproductive biology and pathology. This review focuses on the 2D/3D culture systems of human primary testicular and ovarian cells, highlighting the novel approaches for in vitro study of human reproductive toxicology, specifically in the context of testis and ovary.","2D culture, 3D culture, reproductive organ, human, toxicity"

Modified Histogram Equalization for Improved CNN Medical Image Segmentation,"This research aims to improve the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) in medical image segmentation that will detect specific parts of the body's anatomical structures. Medical images have drawbacks, such as the image's variability, quality, and complexity. We developed image preprocessing scenarios using Histogram Equalization (HE), Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and the hybrid approaches (HE-CLAHE and CLAHE-HE). We propose CNN with image enhancement for image segmentation and evaluate its performance on Lung CT-Scan and Chest X-ray datasets, which totaled 267 and 3616 images, respectively, and had ground truth. The experimental results indicate that the optimal cumulative distribution function (CDF) value of HE is 0 to 39, and the clip limit of CLAHE is 0.01. CNN produces the best segmentation with the addition of the CLAHE-HE approach. This method can increase the accuracy by 1.23 percentage points (training) and 3.22 percentage points (testing) for Lung CT-Scan images. Meanwhile, for Chest X-ray images, the training and testing accuracy increased by 1.58 and 0.96 percentage points. In addition, the proposed medical image segmentation approach using the CNN method with CLAHE-HE obtained the values of comparative coefficients DSC (dice similarity coefficient), and SSIM (structural similarity index measurement) of only about 0.92 and 0.97, respectively.","Medical Image Segmentation, CNN, Image Enhancement, CT-Scan, X-Ray, Histogram Analysis"
"Big data, machine learning, and digital twin assisted additive manufacturing: A review","Additive manufacturing (AM) has undergone significant development over the past decades, resulting in vast amounts of data that carry valuable information. Numerous research studies have been conducted to extract insights from AM data and utilize it for optimizing various aspects such as the manufacturing process, supply chain, and real-time monitoring. Data integration into proposed digital twin frameworks and the application of machine learning techniques is expected to play pivotal roles in advancing AM in the future. In this paper, we provide an overview of machine learning and digital twin-assisted AM. On one hand, we discuss the research domain and highlight the machine-learning methods utilized in this field, including material analysis, design optimization, process parameter optimization, defect detection and monitoring, and sustainability. On the other hand, we examine the status of digital twin-assisted AM from the current research status to the technical approach and offer insights into future developments and perspectives in this area. This review paper aims to examine present research and development in the convergence of big data, machine learning, and digital twin-assisted AM. Although there are numerous review papers on machine learning for additive manufacturing and others on digital twins for AM, no existing paper has considered how these concepts are intrinsically connected and interrelated. Our paper is the first to integrate the three concepts big data, machine learning, and digital twins and propose a cohesive framework for how they can work together to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability of AM processes. By exploring latest advancements and applications within these domains, our objective is to emphasize the potential advantages and future possibilities associated with integration of these technologies in AM.","Additive manufacturing, Big data, Machine learning, Digital twin, Data-driven"
Evaluation of the alternatives of introducing electric vehicles in developing countries using Type-2 neutrosophic numbers based RAFSI model,"This study focuses on implementing electric vehicles (EVs) in developing countries where energy production is mainly based on fossil fuels. Although for these countries the environmental short-run benefits of the EVs cannot offset the short-run costs, it may still be the best option to implement the EVs as soon as possible. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the alternatives to introducing EVs to the market due to the environmental concerns that created an opportunity for some developing countries to catch up with the international competition. Therefore, we develop a case scenario to explore the decision-making process in implementing the EVs with three alternatives and twelve criteria. We solve the decision-making problem by using Type-2 neutrosophic numbers (T2NNs) based on the RAFSI (Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-intervals into a Single Interval) method. The proposed model combines the advantages of the RAFSI technique, and it applies T2NNs to address the uncertainties. The results show that the alternatives that may suspend the implementation of the EVs are inferior. Direct implementation of EVs is prioritized. The policy implications of the results are discussed in the study.","Electric vehicles, Developing countries, Renewable energies, MCDM, Neutrophic sets, RAFSI approach"
A note on the affective computing systems and machines: a classification and appraisal,"Affective computing (AfC) is a continuously growing multidisciplinary field, spanning areas from artificial intelligence, throughout engineering, psychology, education, cognitive science, to sociology. Therefore, many studies have been devoted to the aim of addressing numerous issues, regarding different facets of AfC solutions. However, there is a lack of classification of the AfC systems. This study aims to fill this gap by reviewing and evaluating the state-of-the-art studies in a qualitative manner. In this line of thinking, we put forward a threefold classification that breaks down to desktop and mobile AfC systems, and AfC machines. Moreover, we identified four types of AfC systems, based on the features extracted. In our opinion, the results of this study can serve as a guide for future affect-related research and design, on the one hand, and provide a better understanding on the role of emotions and affect in human-computer interaction, on the other hand.","Affective Computing, Artificial Emotional Intelligence, Classification, System, Machine"
Gene editing enables non-invasive in vivo PET imaging of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived liver bud organoids,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived liver cell therapies such as hepatocyte-like cells and liver organoids could provide unlimited therapeutic cells for clinical transplantation, but an inadequate understanding of their in vivo fate impedes translation. Whole body in vivo imaging could enable monitoring of transplanted cell survival and/or expansion non-invasively over time, permitting robust comparisons between emerging therapies to identify those most effective. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) is a radionuclide reporter gene facilitating whole body in vivo cell tracking by positron emission tomography (PET). We gene-edited a clinical Good Manufacturing Practice-compliant hiPSC line at the AAVS1 safe harbor locus enabling constitutive expression of a hNIS-monomeric(m)GFP fusion reporter in hiPSCs and their differentiated progeny. We confirmed reporter integration did not impact pluripotency or differentiation capacity, and radiotracer uptake capacity was retained post-differentiation. In vivo trackable liver bud (LB) organoids were generated from traceable hNIS fused to monomeric GFP (hNIS-mGFP)-hiPSCs and transplanted into healthy and liver-injured mice. LB were imaged quantitatively by 18FBF4−-PET with imaging results confirmed histologically. We report, for the first time, hNIS-mGFP-hiPSC progeny retain differentiated function and PET trackability in vivo using LB. In vivo monitoring could accelerate regenerative cell therapy development by identifying efficacious candidate cells, successful engraftment/survival strategies and addressing safety concerns.","cell tracking, hepatocyte-like cells, hiPSC, reporter gene imaging, sodium iodide symporter, gene editing, PET, regenerative medicine"
"Identification of benefits, challenges, and pathways in E-commerce industries: An integrated two-phase decision-making model","The e-commerce industry has seen significant growth over the past decade as it focuses on convenience and accessibility, leading to a surge in online shopping with more and more consumers opting for it. At the same time, the e-commerce industry faces various challenges. In order to fully harness the potential of this industry, it is important to identify its benefits and challenges and focus on pathways to mitigate the challenges and harness its growth. This study utilizes the Delphi approach and involves experts from the e-commerce domain to get their opinions to identify the top ten benefits, challenges, and pathways for the e-commerce industry. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) methods are subsequently, employed to prioritize the identified factors. Results of the study revealed that factors such as affordable advertising & marketing; availability and product variety; and Global reachability are the most important benefits, while technological upgradation; returns or refunds; and counterfeit products posed the greatest challenges for the industry. Government compliance check; better relationship with delivery partners; and strong data privacy and online security policies emerged as the best pathways. This study also provides valuable insights to businesses, policymakers, and researchers in the e-commerce industry on how to navigate the benefits, challenges, and pathways of this rapidly growing sector.","E-commerce, Benefits, Challenges, Pathways, Delphi, Analytic hierarchy process, Criteria importance through intercriteria correlation"
Developing and validating a scale of empowerment in using artificial intelligence for problem-solving for senior secondary and university students,"Empowerment enables students to be psychologically and affectively ready to leverage the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI). However, a theory-driven scale to extend empowerment into the use of AI for problem-solving is lacking. This study developed and validated an 11-item scale of empowerment in using AI for problem-solving (EUAIPS) based on a proposed conceptual framework that synthesises empowerment and AI-related literature. The EUAIPS scale encompasses impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness in using AI for problem-solving. We collected data from a diverse sample of Hong Kong senior secondary and university students before (N = 477) and after the course (N = 409). Results demonstrated that the EUAIPS scale with a three-factor structure had good reliability and validity. Students also felt significantly more empowered to use AI for problem-solving after a 14-h course using AI for problem-solving. These findings empirically support the affective dimension of AI literacy and show that psychological control/competence is particularly important for students to harness AI to solve problems at the affective level. This study presents a valid instrument for researchers and practitioners to measure empowerment in using AI for problem-solving and informs AI literacy curriculum designers about including learning activities to help students realise its impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness.","Artificial intelligence literacy, Empowerment, Problem-solving, Scale development, Senior secondary and university students"
Fostering consumer engagement with sustainability marketing using augmented reality (SMART): A climate change response,"As climate change concerns escalate, businesses increasingly realize the pivotal role of consumer engagement through sustainability practices in enhancing brand and firm performance. In a transformative landscape characterized by societal shifts towards environmentally conscious consumer behaviors, the re-evaluation of sustainability marketing strategies is crucial. This need is further amplified by the advent of technologies like augmented reality (AR), which are reshaping market dynamics. This study not only extends the conceptualization of sustainability marketing using AR (SMART) but also proposes a comprehensive measurement scale. This scale is designed to accurately measure consumers’ perceptions of AR-focused sustainability marketing efforts in fostering engagement. Our approach, a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, involved five studies with n = 1072 consumers across the U.S., U.K., and South Africa. We conceptualize consumers’ perceptions of sustainability marketing using AR (SMART) across six dimensions: social equity, economic development, environmental protection, ethical considerations, regulatory measures, and technological innovation. The findings not only underscore the importance of integrating sustainability practices and new-age technologies (i.e., AR to foster climate-positive consumer engagement) but also offer strategic insights that can help businesses thrive in a climate-change era and meet their sustainability objectives.","Sustainability marketing, Climate change, Climate-positive behaviors, Augmented reality, Conceptualization, Measurement"
Assessing alternatives of including social robots in urban transport using fuzzy trigonometric operators based decision-making model,"Current trends point to a not-too-distant future with qualitatively advanced interactions between humans and social robots. It is critical to consider the possibility of forming meaningful social relationships with robots when defining the future of human-robot interactions, as well as studying how these interactions will evolve to the point where humans are unable to distinguish between humans and robots in urban transportation. In this study, the advantages of using social robots in urban transportation are prioritized by using a multi-criteria decision-making tool, which consists of two consecutive stages, namely: i) a novel fuzzy sine trigonometry based on the logarithmic method of additive weights (fuzzy ST-LMAW) that is proposed to calculate the criteria weights; ii) a nonlinear fuzzy Aczel-Alsina function based the weighted aggregate sum product assessment (fuzzy ALWAS-WASPAS) that is developed to select and rank the alternatives. The proposed model enables flexible nonlinear processing of complex and uncertain information encountered in real applications. A case study is developed to rank three alternatives with twelve sub-criteria grouped into four aspects using the proposed method. The results show that the most advantageous alternative is to replace people with social robots as safety drivers in level four autonomous vehicles due to their possible impact on transportation.","Social robots, Urban transportation, Human-robot interaction, Fuzzy sets, Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), Trigonometric operators"
Linking the potentials of extended digital marketing impact and start-up growth: Developing a macro-dynamic framework of start-up growth drivers supported by digital marketing,"The contemporary market positions digital marketing as a powerful mediator between efficient digital interaction, data interpretation opportunities, and business growth, while extending its impact potential to tackle different growth challenges. As start-ups usually have limited resources and struggle with customer engagement, retention, and other growth challenges, the low investment and dynamic elements of digital marketing tools can be used to support constructive digital interactions impacting start-up growth. Consequently, these links have outlined an extended digital marketing impact in the areas which build on marketing and sales and influence growth components such as product & market testing, customer engagement, and partnership development. Through a systematic literature review, we present a holistic overview encompassing start-up growth areas that use digital marketing. We also discuss how digital marketing efforts complement the start-up maturity. Furthermore, we analyze the differences in B2B and B2C digital marketing usage and discuss how emerging technologies impact digital marketing. The link between the extended digital marketing impact, start-up challenges, and growth areas result in the identification of start-up growth drivers supported by digital marketing. We propose a Macro-Dynamic framework identifying the start-up growth drivers from product, market, team, and finance areas and digital marketing tactics connected to the identified growth drivers.","Digital marketing tools, Digital marketing extended impact, Emerging technologies, Start-up challenges, Start-up maturity, Start-up growth"
A hybrid analytical concept to QoE index evaluation: Enhancing eMBB service detection in 5G SA networks,"The launch of commercial 5G networks has unlocked numerous opportunities for heavy data users and high-speed applications. The expected requirements for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) are pushing end-users to adopt 5G optimistically. Though already deployed 5G networks have shown high data rates and very low latency, the service-based experience and application behavior have been challenging to monitor. The legacy quality of experience (QoE) and service (QoS) monitoring and evaluation techniques have shown limitations in 5G standalone networks. The current 5G deployment large amount of user plane traffic generated by end-users makes the legacy-monitoring task very costly for mobile network operators (MNOs). And the complexity of the projected future 5G architecture, including advanced technologies such as network functions virtualization (NFV), software-defined networking (SDN), and network slicing, makes traditional service detection and QoE assessment ineffective. In this paper, we discuss a cost-effective hybrid analytical approach to eMBB service detection, analysis, and perceived user QoE measurement from raw traffic in a live 5G standalone (SA) network. We first use flow-level-based packet inspection and machine learning to detect and classify eMBB services from raw traffic. We then use a statistical approach to compute the user quality index (UQI). The concept is tested on traffic captured on a fixed 5G SA network. And the output enabled the MNO to have a 5G QoE assessment structure and awareness to adjust network traffic policies.","5G standalone network, Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), Machine learning, Network functions virtualization (NFV), Service awareness, Quality of service (QoS), Quality of experience (QoE), Software-defined networks (SDN)"
The computing continuum: From IoT to the cloud,"In the era of the IoT revolution, applications are becoming ever more sophisticated and accompanied by diverse functional and non-functional requirements, including those related to computing resources and performance levels. Such requirements make the development and implementation of these applications complex and challenging. Computing models, such as cloud computing, can provide applications with on-demand computation and storage resources to meet their needs. Although cloud computing is a great enabler for IoT and endpoint devices, its limitations make it unsuitable to fulfill all design goals of novel applications and use cases. Instead of only relying on cloud computing, leveraging and integrating resources at different layers (like IoT, edge, and cloud) is necessary to form and utilize a computing continuum. The layers’ integration in the computing continuum offers a wide range of innovative services, but it introduces new challenges (e.g., monitoring performance and ensuring security) that need to be investigated. A better grasp and more profound understanding of the computing continuum can guide researchers and developers in tackling and overcoming such challenges. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive and unified view of the computing continuum. The paper discusses computing models in general with a focus on cloud computing, the computing models that emerged beyond the cloud, and the communication technologies that enable computing in the continuum. In addition, two novel reference architectures are presented in this work: one for edge–cloud computing models and the other for edge–cloud communication technologies. We demonstrate real use cases from different application domains (like industry and science) to validate the proposed reference architectures, and we show how these use cases map onto the reference architectures. Finally, the paper highlights key points that express the authors’ vision about efficiently enabling and utilizing the computing continuum in the future.","Computing continuum, Cloud computing, Fog computing, Edge computing, Mobile cloud computing, Multi-access edge computing, SDN, NFV, IoT, Use case, Reference architecture"
"Public Policies, Open Innovation Ecosystems and Innovation Performance. Analysis of the Impact of Funding and Regulations","ABSTRACT Open innovation (OI) has been implemented to develop competitive advantages based on the management of innovation with external players. As such, it is expected that the generalized adoption of OI practices needs to be nurtured by governmental public policies in order to enhance OI-based ecosystems. The role of open innovation ecosystems is known by the importance of multiple synergies among players/stakeholders, which are expected to be supported by regulations and funding to consolidate firms’ innovation results. This paper analyzes the role of regulations and funding on firms’ innovation performance using the double-hurdle estimation procedure. The results show that, in the first tier, inbound knowledge flows positively affect performance, and, in the second tier, public funds further reinforce innovation performance and fiscal and security regulations. In contrast, as regulations are perceived as barriers, they fail to impact innovation performance. With this paper, we manage to shed light on the importance of public policy funds in the support of thriving OI-based ecosystems as enhancers of firms’ innovation performance.","open innovation, regulations, funds, innovation performance, CIS, double-hurdle model, Cragg’s Tobit"
Current opportunities and challenges of immersive virtual reality for psychological research and application,"Immersive virtual reality (iVR), that is, digital stereoscopic 360° scenarios usually presented in head-mounted displays, has gained much popularity in medical, educational, and consumer contexts in the last years. Recently, psychological research started to utilize the theoretical and methodological advantages of iVR. Furthermore, understanding cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes in iVR similar to real-life is a genuinely psychological, currently understudied topic. This article briefly reviews the current application of iVR in psychological research and related disciplines. The review presents empirical evidence for opportunities and strengths (e.g., realism, experimental control, effectiveness of therapeutic and educational interventions) as well as challenges and weaknesses (e.g., differences in experiencing presence, interacting with VR content including avatars, i.e., graphical representation of a person). The main part discusses areas requiring additional basic research, such as cognitive processes, socio-emotional processes during social interactions in iVR, and possible societal implications (e.g., fraud, VR-addiction). For both research and application, iVR offers a contemporary extension of the psychological toolkit, offering new avenues to investigate and enhance core phenomena of psychology such as cognition, affect, motivation, and behavior. Still, it is crucial to exercise caution in its application as excessive and careless use of iVR can pose risks to individuals' mental and physical well-being.","Virtual reality, Cognitive processes, Socio-emotional processes, Psychotherapy, Education, Societal implications"
"Scenario-based analysis for industrial project planning in the context of carbon peaking: Case study city, China","The Chinese government is actively pursuing a low-carbon development model with a clear target of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030. This study presents a project-based perspective on CO2 emissions from the industrial sector in the city. The article quantifies and analyzes the project planning by including the entire gross industrial production value, industrial structure, energy intensity, energy structure, and CO2 emission coefficient of the industrial sector's CO2 emissions decomposition model. Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis were coupled to evaluate how the city's industrial sector could achieve its peak carbon targets by industry. The expected range of CO2 emissions from the city's industrial sector in 2025, 2030, and 2035, based on the project plan and policies in place, is projected to be between 65.64 and 69.26 Mt, 72.13–78.48 Mt, and 69.32–76.62 Mt. However, the simulations show that there are still considerable uncertainties in reaching the peak carbon target in 2030, necessitating greater government efforts. To achieve the 2030 goal for the city's industrial sector, the paper recommends that the government increase the baseline criteria for industrial structure, energy intensity, and energy structure. This study provides scientific project planning guidance for Chinese cities to successfully achieve the 2030 goal.","Carbon peaking, Project planning, Industry sector, City, Monte Carlo"
An intelligent glove interface with integrated perceptual simulation and motion tracking for enhanced virtual interactions,"Summary Emerging technologies that bridge the real and virtual worlds are pivotal for enhancing virtual interactions. Current devices, such as smart gloves, often focus solely on hand motion tracking or provide limited haptic feedback, restricting user experiences. Here, a haptic intelligent motion tracking (HIMT) glove designed for enhanced virtual interactions is proposed. The glove includes optimized electromagnetic vibrators that allow users to perceive the shapes and weights of virtual objects accurately. Additionally, graphene fiber sensors were developed for upper-limb motion tracking incorporating inertial measurement units (IMUs). Evaluations in virtual interactive physiotherapy demonstrate that the glove enhances the willingness to engage in rehabilitation training. Furthermore, users achieve a high diagnostic accuracy of 96.1% when assessing virtual patients. The HIMT glove demonstrates significant potential as a comprehensive solution for human-virtual interactions, promising wide future applications in fields such as physiotherapy, medical training, education, sports, and entertainment.","smart glove, electromagnetic vibrator, fiber sensor, motion tracking, virtual reality, physiotherapy, clinical diagnosis"
21st century progress in computing,"In the search for explanations for slower productivity growth since the mid-2000s in many countries, one possibility is a slower pace of progress in digital technologies. In this paper we show that the cost of computation has continued to decline rapidly, taking into account innovation in chip types and cloud computing. This is a continuation of its long-run trend; the decline has slowed since 2010, but not earlier. As firms use computational power along with other inputs including relevant human and organisational capital, to the extent that the productivity slowdown is linked to technology use the explanation is likely to lie in these other elements of the input bundle.","Computation, Prices, Productivity, AI, Cloud computing"

Balancing privacy and performance in federated learning: A systematic literature review on methods and metrics,"Federated learning (FL) as a novel paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ensures enhanced privacy by eliminating data centralization and brings learning directly to the edge of the user's device. Nevertheless, new privacy issues have been raised particularly during training and the exchange of parameters between servers and clients. While several privacy-preserving FL solutions have been developed to mitigate potential breaches in FL architectures, their integration poses its own set of challenges. Incorporating these privacy-preserving mechanisms into FL at the edge computing level can increase both communication and computational overheads, which may, in turn, compromise data utility and learning performance metrics. This paper provides a systematic literature review on essential methods and metrics to support the most appropriate trade-offs between FL privacy and other performance-related application requirements such as accuracy, loss, convergence time, utility, communication, and computation overhead. We aim to provide an extensive overview of recent privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL used across various applications, placing a particular focus on quantitative privacy assessment approaches in FL and the necessity of achieving a balance between privacy and the other requirements of real-world FL applications. This review collects, classifies, and discusses relevant papers in a structured manner, emphasizing challenges, open issues, and promising research directions.","Distributed artificial intelligence, Federated learning, Cybersecurity, Trustworthiness, Performance evaluation"
"Computational approaches to Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Advances in theory, applications and trends","Deep Learning (DL), a groundbreaking branch of Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a driving force in both theoretical and applied Artificial Intelligence (AI). DL algorithms, rooted in complex and non-linear artificial neural systems, excel at extracting high-level features from data. DL has demonstrated human-level performance in real-world tasks, including clinical diagnostics, and has unlocked solutions to previously intractable problems in virtual agent design, robotics, genomics, neuroimaging, computer vision, and industrial automation. In this paper, the most relevant advances from the last few years in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and several applications to neuroscience, neuroimaging, computer vision, and robotics are presented, reviewed and discussed. In this way, we summarize the state-of-the-art in AI methods, models and applications within a collection of works presented at the 9th International Conference on the Interplay between Natural and Artificial Computation (IWINAC).

In search of better methods for the longitudinal assessment of tech-derived X-risks: How five leading scenario planning efforts can help,"This mixed methods article discusses the role of scenario analysis as a tool to assess the broadest possible specter of positive and negative effects of technologies and social processes within current existential risk assessment and research. To do so, it compares and contrasts case studies of five ongoing, longitudinal scenario planning efforts of global nature– the Shell scenarios, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the CSIS Seven Revolutions Scenarios, The Millennium Project's State of The Future, and the NIC's Global Trends 2040, to derive lessons for whether and how the adjacent existential risk (X-risk) and tech assessment communities can better deploy scenario planning methodology. Observations are derived from interviews with practitioners involved in these efforts as well as an assessment of the publicly available material issued by each project, including the scenarios produced. The emphasis is on the methodologies used, the timelines considered, the forces each identifies as important scenario drivers, and the process of engagement once scenarios are created. Three practices identified include (1) constructing narratives based on strong data, (2) sticking to plausible scenarios (not wild cards), and (3) designing a process of engagement, which each of these does well albeit in different ways. The article concludes with a few brief recommendations for future scenario planning efforts, particularly relevant for x-risk studies that aim to be relevant for tech assessment and governance. Overall, this review shows global scenario efforts aimed at influencing governance would benefit from (a) a more uniformly shared vocabulary, (b) an underlying theory of cascading systemic change, (c) deeper methodological transparency, (d) increased transdisciplinary perspectives, yet (e) maintaining scientific rigor. These improvements would particularly benefit emerging tech-risk derived X-risk scenario efforts where the stakes are the highest they could be, safeguarding humanity's future.","Forecasting, Methods, Human extinction, Global catastrophic risks (GCRs), Scenario methods, Existential risks"
Federated Learning for improved prediction of failures in Autonomous Guided Vehicles,"Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are nowadays an indispensable component of production lines in smart manufacturing. Managing the fleet of AGVs covers not only the delegation of operational tasks but also the monitoring of AGVs activity and health condition by applying tailored Machine Learning-based methods to detect anomalies in various signals gathered by edge IoT devices mounted on board. Detecting anomalies requires appropriate prediction of selected signals based on multiple types of sensor readings. Momentary energy consumption is one of the signals that can indicate abnormal states in AGVs. In this paper, we show that the prediction of this signal can be improved with the Federated Learning (FL) approach that involves exchanging experience gained by particular AGVs. This paper significantly extends the conference paper (Shubyn et al., 2022) with the new multi-round approach to building global prediction models and recent experiments on real data streams produced by AGVs designed by the AIUT company. The results of our experiments prove that in the AGV operational environments with distributed knowledge Federated Learning performs better than traditional centralized approaches and that frequent synchronization of experience may lead to better prediction quality.","Federated Learning, Autonomous Guided Vehicles, Smart manufacturing, Prediction, Industry 4.0"
"Smart-enhanced organisational functions: A framework comprising capabilities, barriers, and evolutional path","Integrating smart industrial products (SIPs) into production processes introduces new dynamics of capabilities and challenges within organisations. However, a prevalent issue is the ad hoc adoption of SIPs without a cohesive strategy, resulting in isolated solutions that do not effectively enhance core organisational functions. Our research fills this critical gap by identifying and combining the capabilities and barriers posed by SIPs. Our findings allow us to propose a framework comprising the stages each main organisational function needs to develop to move from a traditional to a completely autonomous decision-making function. This evolutional path requires that each organisational function acquires selected capabilities and overcomes specific barriers. Our approach encompasses a multi-method methodology, commencing with a systematic literature review (SLR) encompassing 44 papers, leading to the identification of 20 capabilities and 23 barriers. Subsequently, through rigorous content analyses and expert interviews, we formulate the framework. This paper contributes to academia by providing a framework with an evolutional path that main organisational functions may follow according to the capability they acquire from the SIP and which barriers should be surpassed at each level. For managers in practice, the proposed framework enables a better understanding of the stage of their operations and which capabilities will take their main organisational function from traditional (level 0) to autonomous (level 3) stages.","Barriers, Capabilities, Connected products, Smart production, Smart industrial products"
Digital Twin based Smart Manufacturing; From Design to Simulation and Optimization Schema,"The advent of new-generation information and communication technologies, such as Generative AI, Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, Blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence (AI), has led to the emergence of the era of big data in recent years. Digital twin has emerged as one of the most active components in smart manufacturing, garnering significant attention from enterprises, research institutes, and researchers. By creating a digital twin, manufacturers can simulate different scenarios and test various configurations without disrupting the actual production process. This allows for more efficient testing and optimization of production processes, as well as improved quality control and predictive maintenance. Overall, digital twins are an important tool in smart production that can help manufacturers improve efficiency and reduce costs while ensuring high-quality output. In this paper, after reviewing the literature on the subject, in this article, by reviewing the literature, we presented a framework of the digital twin in smart manufacturing, which includes Optimization, Predictive Maintenance, Quality Control, Design, and Simulation, which can be a good guide for future studies.","Digital Twin, Smart Manufacturing, Internet of Things, Predictive Maintenance, Optimization & Simulation"
"ACMSD inhibition corrects fibrosis, inflammation, and DNA damage in MASLD/MASH","Background & Aims Recent findings reveal the importance of tryptophan-initiated de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis in the liver, a process previously considered secondary to biosynthesis from nicotinamide. The enzyme α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, acts as a modulator of de novo NAD+ synthesis. Boosting NAD+ levels has previously demonstrated remarkable metabolic benefits in mouse models. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic implications of ACMSD inhibition in the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/steatohepatitis (MASLD/MASH). Methods In vitro experiments were conducted in primary rodent hepatocytes, Huh7 human liver carcinoma cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human liver organoids (HLOs). C57BL/6J male mice were fed a western-style diet and housed at thermoneutrality to recapitulate key aspects of MASLD/MASH. Pharmacological ACMSD inhibition was given therapeutically, following disease onset. HLO models of steatohepatitis were used to assess the DNA damage responses to ACMSD inhibition in human contexts. Results Inhibiting ACMSD with a novel specific pharmacological inhibitor promotes de novo NAD+ synthesis and reduces DNA damage ex vivo, in vivo, and in HLO models. In mouse models of MASLD/MASH, de novo NAD+ biosynthesis is suppressed, and transcriptomic DNA damage signatures correlate with disease severity; in humans, Mendelian randomization-based genetic analysis suggests a notable impact of genomic stress on liver disease susceptibility. Therapeutic inhibition of ACMSD in mice increases liver NAD+ and reverses MASLD/MASH, mitigating fibrosis, inflammation, and DNA damage, as observed in HLO models of steatohepatitis. Conclusions Our findings highlight the benefits of ACMSD inhibition in enhancing hepatic NAD+ levels and enabling genomic protection, underscoring its therapeutic potential in MASLD/MASH. Impact and implications Enhancing NAD+ levels has been shown to induce remarkable health benefits in mouse models of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/steatohepatitis (MASLD/MASH), yet liver-specific NAD+ boosting strategies remain underexplored. Here, we present a novel pharmacological approach to enhance de novo synthesis of NAD+ in the liver by inhibiting α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), an enzyme highly expressed in the liver. Inhibiting ACMSD increases NAD+ levels, enhances mitochondrial respiration, and maintains genomic stability in hepatocytes ex vivo and in vivo.

Hedging with automatic liquidation and leverage selection on bitcoin futures,"Bitcoin derivatives positions are maintained with a self-selected margin, which is often too low to avoid automatic liquidation by the exchange, without notice, especially during periods of excessive volatility. Indeed, according to CryptoQuant, almost $80 billion of positions on centralised exchanges were liquidated during 2021, that is an average of over $200 million per day. So hedgers of bitcoin price risk should account for the possibility of automatic liquidation when taking positions on bitcoin futures. We derive a semi-closed form for an optimal hedging strategy with dual objectives – to minimize both the variance of the hedged portfolio and the probability of liquidation due to insufficient collateral. The solution depends on the statistical characteristics of the spot and futures extreme returns, and other parameters that characterize the hedger by choice of leverage, loss aversion and collateral management. An empirical analysis based on minute-level data compares the performance of the major direct and inverse bitcoin hedging instruments traded on five major exchanges.","Finance, Cryptocurrency, Leverage, Liquidation, Perpetual swap"
CrowdRouting: Trustworthy and customized cross-domain routing based on crowdsourcing,"Cross-domain routing in Integrated Heterogeneous Networks (Inte-HetNet) should ensure efficient and secure data transmission across different network domains by satisfying diverse routing requirements. However, current solutions face numerous challenges in continuously ensuring trustworthy routing, fulfilling diverse requirements, achieving reasonable resource allocation, and safeguarding against malicious behaviors of network operators. We propose CrowdRouting, a novel cross-domain routing scheme based on crowdsourcing, dedicated to establishing sustained trust in cross-domain routing, comprehensively considering and fulfilling various customized routing requirements, while ensuring reasonable resource allocation and effectively curbing malicious behavior of network operators. Concretely, CrowdRouting employs blockchain technology to verify the trustworthiness of border routers in different network domains, thereby establishing sustainable and trustworthy cross-domain routing based on sustained trust in these routers. In addition, CrowdRouting ingeniously integrates a crowdsourcing mechanism into the auction for routing, achieving fair and impartial allocation of routing rights by flexibly embedding various customized routing requirements into each auction phase. Moreover, CrowdRouting leverages incentive mechanisms and routing settlement to encourage network domains to actively participate in cross-domain routing, thereby promoting optimal resource allocation and efficient utilization. Furthermore, CrowdRouting introduces a supervisory agency (e.g., undercover agent) to effectively suppress the malicious behavior of network operators through the game and interaction between the agent and the network operators. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing works, we demonstrate that CrowdRouting excels in providing trustworthy and fine-grained customized routing services, stimulating active participation in cross-domain routing, inhibiting malicious operator behavior, and maintaining reasonable resource allocation, all of which outperform baseline schemes.","Trustworthy routing, Cross-domain routing, Customized routing, Crowdsourcing"
"Human versus virtual influences, a comparative study","Influencer marketing aims to promote brands and influence consumer decisions, and recent technological advances have created options for non-human, virtual influencers. Such developments suggest the need to determine whether the effects of virtual influencers on consumer decisions differ from those of human influencers, depending on the type of product they are promoting. With a 2 (virtual vs. human influencer) × 2 (utilitarian vs. hedonic product) experimental design, using Instagram influencer posts and data from 275 participants, the current research establishes that the type of influencer does not affect intentions to adopt recommendations. But the influence process varies by type of influencer: Virtual influencers’ recommendations appear more useful, especially for utilitarian products, but consumers identify more with human influencers’ posts. Both usefulness and identification increase intention to adopt influencers’ recommendation. Overall, these results suggest that, while virtual influencers should endorse utilitarian products, human influencers should be hired to endorse hedonic products.","Virtual influencer, Human influencer, Identification, Usefulness, Behavioral intention, Type of product"
Exploring the effect of VR-enhanced teaching aids in STEAM education: An embodied cognition perspective,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of Physical Teaching Aids (PTAs) and VR-Enhanced Teaching Aids (VETAs) on students’ learning performance, attitudes, and classroom interactions in a STEAM course. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a total of 85 fifth-grade students, 42 in the treatment group and 43 in the control group. The students in the treatment group reported a high level of acceptance of the VETAs in the post-course interview. The Lag Sequential Analysis results indicated that the use of VETAs improved students' learning performance and made the classroom more learner-centered than those who were facilitated with PTAs. In the treatment group, students were able to investigate problems more actively, practice and innovate more interactively, and achieve deeper learning. The current study further elaborates on the reasons and summarizes the mechanism of VETAs supporting the perceptual field in STEAM education.","Perceptual field, STEAM education, VR-Enhanced teaching aids (VETAs)"
Decentralization illusion in Decentralized Finance: Evidence from tokenized voting in MakerDAO polls,"Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is very popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications as it provides a decentralized governance solution through blockchain. We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.","decentralized finance, blockchain, tokens, governance"

Simplifying Crowd Automation in the Virtual Laboratory of Archaeology,"Virtual archaeology projects have been evolving to go beyond a mere reconstruction of architecture and artefacts of heritage sites: human interaction with the environment is also an object of research for historians and archaeologists. Methodologies like the London Charter propose that historians and archaeologists, in close collaboration with technical teams, lead virtual archaeology projects to guarantee the credibility and scientific validation of the result. The question is how to allow historians to model crowds on their own, if lacking the required skills to programme complex artificial intelligent-driven autonomous agents. In this article a method is proposed, currently under development, to allow non-programmers will be able to successfully model crowds using very simple tools that do not require formal programming knowledge but can still provide convincing results. The underlying idea is to employ concepts borrowed from computer games, whose interfaces are targeted to non-experts and adapt them to the specificities of virtual world platforms like Second Life® and OpenSimulator. Moreover, some limitations and ideas for further extension are discussed.","Second Life, OpenSimulator, Artifircial intelligence, Virtual archaeology, Genetic algorithms, Bots"
Human-centric assembly in smart factories,"Assembly in future smart factories needs to address three challenges, including human centricity, sustainability, and resilience.

To ease the burden on humans both physically and intellectually, human-centric assembly enhanced by augmented robots, cognitive systems, mixed reality and collaborative intelligence, assisted by thought-driven brain robotic controls, provides a promising solution. Within the context, this keynote provides an in-depth analysis of the state of human-centric assembly and identifies potentially fruitful research directions in future smart factories.","Assembly, Robot, Human-centricity"
"Digital technologies and carbon neutrality goals: An in-depth investigation of drivers, barriers, and risk mitigation strategies","Prior research has primarily concentrated on non-digital and process-oriented methods for achieving carbon neutrality (CN) in the context of mitigating climate change (CC), while the potential of digital technology (DT) has hardly been investigated. This study addresses this gap by answering four research questions: How are firms utilizing DT to achieve CN? What drives the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What are the barriers that prevent the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What risk mitigation strategies can be adopted by firms to overcome these barriers? An inductive method using open-ended essays has been adopted to gather data from firms that have already implemented DT for CN. The findings revealed four distinct dimensions. Utilization of DT for CN includes enhancing business value, managing one's carbon footprint, enabling smart solutions, and enhancing efficiency. The drivers for adopting DT for CN included driving business growth, external pressures, competitive advantage, and environmental consciousness. Key barriers included financial barriers, technological barriers, human resource barriers, and external barriers. Risk mitigation strategies included pre-implementation strategies, detailed planning and evaluation, ensuring employees' buy-in and readiness, and external stakeholder engagement. This study offers a broad-based foundation for designing DT strategies for achieving CN.",", , , , , , ,"
Enhanced Dynamic Deep Q-Network for Federated Learning scheduling policies on IoT devices using explanation-driven trust,"Recent advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing have led to rapid growth in the number of IoT devices generating extensive volumes of data at the network edge. Efficiently scheduling tasks on these devices, particularly under strict latency constraints in federated learning (FL) environments, poses substantial challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-energy-aware scheduling framework specifically designed for latency-constrained federated edge computing scenarios. Our innovative strategy integrates Dynamic Deep Q-Network (Dynamic-DQN) reinforcement learning with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabling dynamic, real-time assessment of device trustworthiness with interpretability and transparency. This combined approach allows the framework to intelligently allocate tasks to IoT devices, explicitly optimizing for reduced latency, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced system reliability. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that our proposed method substantially outperforms conventional reinforcement learning and heuristic scheduling algorithms, demonstrating significant reductions in latency, superior energy management, and improved scalability. These results underscore the robustness and practical effectiveness of our framework in addressing critical FL challenges.","Internet of Things (IoT), Edge computing, Federated learning (FL), Trust, Task scheduling, Dynamic Deep Q-Network (Dynamic-DQN), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)"
Self-proximity in augmented reality enhances consumer’s responses to green products through anticipated warm glow,"Encouraging online green purchasing requires overcoming the abstract nature of e-commerce and making the environmental benefits of green products more tangible. Augmented reality (AR) is a promising tool that allows consumers to try on green products virtually, fostering self-proximity—the perception that the augmented self-representation is close to oneself. We explore how and under what conditions AR-enabled self-proximity enhances consumer responses to green products. We find that AR-enabled self-proximity enhances the personal relevance of green products, heightens the anticipated warm glow, and improves consumer responses to green products. AR is particularly effective in promoting green purchasing because it heightens anticipated warm glow, which in turn leads to higher purchase intentions for green products than for generic ones. We highlight the need to carefully design AR experiences that emphasize self-relevance and intrinsic rewards to maximize impact, offer practical recommendations, and suggest avenues for future research in this growing area of study.","Green product, Augmented reality, Anticipated warm glow, E-commerce, Sustainability, Construal-level theory"
Dynamic digital capabilities and supply chain resilience: The role of government effectiveness,"Organizations in recent times are increasingly investing in building supply chain resilience following disruptions due to natural disasters, geo-political crises, and pandemics. A lack of government support has exacerbated the disruption to supply chains in some regions of the world. The positive influence of digitalization on social inclusion, government accountability, and creating a more open environment is well understood. Despite this, different countries have shown varying degrees of digital responsiveness during the pandemic as they attempted to deal with the effects of various COVID strains. The influence of government policies on the supply chain has not been examined in the literature so far and, hence, to address this research gap, we examine the interaction effect of government support effectiveness i.e., tax credits, interest deferral, digital investment, soft loans on dynamic capabilities i.e., digital adaptabilities and digital agilities and on supply chain resilience, using a multi-method approach. To understand how digital adaptability and agility improve supply chain resilience, we conducted 13 semi-structured interviews. Additionally, we pretested our measurement instrument using qualitative semi-structured interviews to validate our hypothesized relationships. We collected data at a specific point of time using a survey-based instrument (N = 203) to address our research questions. Based on data analyses of both the qualitative and survey-based data, our findings indicate that digital adaptability is an important driver of digital agility. Furthermore, the results indicate that government effectiveness is crucial to enhancing supply chain resilience by enhancing digital adaptability and agility. Our research makes some useful contributions to the dynamic capability view by enhancing theoretical understanding, of the role of government in building digital capabilities in uncertain times, to improve supply chain resilience. It also bridges the research gaps between macro and micro perspectives, as identified by management scholars. Lastly, we noted the weaknesses and limitations in the study and therefore we have offered multiple research directions forward, that could help researchers to further develop our current work.","Digital agility, Digital adaptability, Dynamic capability, Government effectiveness, Supply chain resilience"
"Decentralized project delivery on the crypto commons: Conceptualization, governance mechanisms, and future research directions","This paper presents a first conceptualization for decentralized project delivery through the combination of blockchain technology and common pool resource governance theory, also known as the ”crypto commons”. While previous literature on project delivery models identifies the use of decentralized governance, there is not yet a holistic conceptualization nor a specific overview of governance applications that can be applied. To develop the concept, we use a literature review to synthesize fourteen blockchain governance mechanisms useful for managing the crypto-commons. Subsequently, we use systematic combining to identify twenty-two specific applications for decentralized project delivery in the construction industry, one of the largest project-based industries. Each application is briefly reviewed, and examples of their relevance to realize decentralized project delivery models are provided. We discuss the potential for novel forms of project delivery, but also the need for future research on the applications, as well as on the system level implications, the system design challenges, and the implementation barriers in the specific context of the construction industry. Overall, the concepts and mechanisms presented provide a theoretical foundation upon which future researchers can use to design novel decentralized project delivery models.","Blockchain, Commons, Common pool resources, Integrated project delivery, Collaborative project delivery, Smart contracts, DAO"
Leveraging on cultural and creative industries to foster social innovation: A bibliometric analysis,"This study investigated the interplay between community-based cultural initiatives conducted by Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) and social innovation. Selecting peer-reviewed open-access articles that focus on the intersection of culture and innovation was the first step in our systematic literature review. Our analysis focused on the 76 most cited papers that included the keywords ‘community-led local development’, ‘social innovation’, and ‘cultural and creative industries’. The literature review revealed that CCIs can significantly promote social innovation through cultural engagement, particularly when they collaborate with various stakeholders. However, researchers differ in their emphasis on the nature of collaboration. Some argue that partnerships with businesses or academic institutions are essential for creating ‘heterogeneous sources of knowledge’ (HSK). Others contend that collaboration between government entities and local authorities is vital for fostering regional and local development. The third perspective introduces the notion of ‘entrepreneurial co-creation’, suggesting that CCIs work alongside stakeholders with technical and managerial expertise. Finally, there is a consensus that CCIs need to acquire new leadership skills and competencies to ensure sustainability and resilience. By synthesising these four perspectives, this study offers a comprehensive framework that positions CCIs at the core of a broader economic, territorial, managerial, and political context.","Social innovation, Culture, Cultural and creative industries, Participation, People-led"
Embracing entrepreneurship in the creator economy: The rise of creatrepreneurs,"The creator economy has led to profound transformations in the way that individuals—content creators—produce and deliver digital content, how they create and appropriate value from such content, and how they grow careers in venturing such content creation. However, despite the industry’s economic significance, the conceptualization of content creators as entrepreneurs remains underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by exploring creators from an entrepreneurial perspective along a creatrepreneur model. Based on an extensive review of academic research, industry reports, as well as eight expert interviews with diverse stakeholders within the creator economy ecosystem, the article defines the scope of creators’ entrepreneurial activities, offers a taxonomy of creator venture models, and develops a framework of key drivers of entrepreneurial success within the creator economy, encompassing both environmental and individual success factors. Building on this conceptualization, this paper further identifies potential avenues for future research in the creator economy, focusing on entrepreneurial strategies in building creator ventures and evaluating their key success factors, and concludes by highlighting empirical challenges in exploring these directions.","Creator economy, Content creators, Influencers, Entrepreneurship, Startups, New ventures, Digital ventures"

Asian diversity in human immune cells,"Summary The relationships of human diversity with biomedical phenotypes are pervasive yet remain understudied, particularly in a single-cell genomics context. Here, we present the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas (AIDA), a multi-national single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) healthy reference atlas of human immune cells. AIDA comprises 1,265,624 circulating immune cells from 619 donors, spanning 7 population groups across 5 Asian countries, and 6 controls. Though population groups are frequently compared at the continental level, we found that sub-continental diversity, age, and sex pervasively impacted cellular and molecular properties of immune cells. These included differential abundance of cell neighborhoods as well as cell populations and genes relevant to disease risk, pathogenesis, and diagnostics. We discovered functional genetic variants influencing cell-type-specific gene expression, which were under-represented in non-Asian populations, and helped contextualize disease-associated variants. AIDA enables analyses of multi-ancestry disease datasets and facilitates the development of precision medicine efforts in Asia and beyond.","genomics, genetics, single-cell RNA sequencing, human diversity, sub-continental diversity, genetic diversity, immune cells, healthy baseline, eQTL, precision medicine"

The Tong Test: Evaluating Artificial General Intelligence Through Dynamic Embodied Physical and Social Interactions,"The release of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series has brought artificial general intelligence (AGI) to the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) field once again. However, the questions of how to define and evaluate AGI remain unclear. This perspective article proposes that the evaluation of AGI should be rooted in dynamic embodied physical and social interactions (DEPSI). More specifically, we propose five critical characteristics to be considered as AGI benchmarks and suggest the Tong test as an AGI evaluation system. The Tong test describes a value- and ability-oriented testing system that delineates five levels of AGI milestones through a virtual environment with DEPSI, allowing for infinite task generation. We contrast the Tong test with classical AI testing systems in terms of various aspects and propose a systematic evaluation system to promote standardized, quantitative, and objective benchmarks and evaluation of AGI.","Artificial general intelligence, Artificial intelligence benchmark, Artificial intelligence evaluation, Embodied artificial intelligence, Value alignment, Turing test, Causality"
A spatiotemporal intelligent framework and experimental platform for urban digital twins,"Backgrounds This work emphasizes the current research status of the urban Digital Twins to establish an intelligent spatiotemporal framework.

Public libraries as a partner in digital innovation project: Designing a virtual reality experience to support digital literacy,"We introduce a project titled as Our Shared Virtual World which aims at increasing public libraries’ capability to provide knowledge on digital technology to general public. The practical goal of the project has been to produce a functional prototype of a virtual reality (VR) application that could be utilized freely in all the public libraries in Finland. In many countries worldwide, libraries’ role is expanding from providers of traditional books to providers of information technologies and related new forms of literacy, and this development provides the broader backdrop for the project. The contribution of the article is two-fold: First, we describe how an immersive VR application can be collaboratively developed within this specific research context, namely within a network of public libraries, and introduce the tangible outcome of the project, the VR application called Forest Elf. Secondly, we scrutinize how results of such a design work can be sustained over time: through participatory design (PD), we aimed at creating conditions which would enable public libraries to continue developing and using the artefact also after the project. We provide insights on how to tackle the challenge of research prototypes ending up being abandoned, and what factors in the context of library partnership support or hamper sustainable digital innovation — digital innovation that is inclusive and equitable but also has a long-lasting impact.","Public libraries, Participatory design, Virtual reality, Digital literacy, Digital social innovation, Research-through-design"
"Transformative marketing in the new normal: A novel practice-scholarly integrative review of business-to-business marketing mix challenges, opportunities, and solutions","Transformative marketing has been heralded as the future of marketing. While the initial catalyst for transformative marketing was the desire of customers for more meaningful engagement, the global impact of great crises (or mega disruptions) has accelerated the evolution of transformative marketing. With a focus on business-to-business (B2B) marketing, this article aims to offer transformative marketing insights to support B2B marketers in preparing for, navigating in, and recovering from great crises using the great lockdown that transpired during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a case.

Therefore, this article contributes in two major ways: the first from a theoretical perspective, by extending the theoretical generalizability of transformative marketing, and the second from a managerial standpoint, by shedding light on practitioner issues and offering practical suggestions for B2B marketers to prepare for, navigate in, and recover from great crises in the new normal.","Business-to-business, B2B, Coronavirus, COVID-19, Crisis, Great crises, Disruption, Mega disruption, Lockdown, Integrative review, Marketing mix, New normal, Practice, Scholarly, Transformative marketing"
Classification of human-written and AI-generated sentences using a hybrid CNN-GRU model optimized by the spotted hyena algorithm,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in generating human-like text poses significant challenges in distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated content. Recent advancements in natural language generation have significantly enhanced the quality and variety of AI-generated text, making it almost indistinguishable from human-written content. ChatGPT, a popular AI model, belongs to the generative pre-trained transformer family. While human content is created with a clear intent to convey meaning, AI-generated text aims to replicate human-like language. Classifying human-written and AI-generated sentences is crucial for addressing issues like fake news, plagiarism, and spamming. AI text often follows repetitive patterns, while human writing is more creative and original, making detection significant for combating misinformation. Therefore, this study proposes to classify human-written and AI-generated sentences using a hybrid CNN-GRU model optimized by the Spotted Hyena Algorithm (CHWAIG-DLSHO) approach. The approach involves preprocessing text data through tokenization, lemmatization, and data splitting, followed by word embedding using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). A hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is employed for sentence classification. The spotted hyena optimizer (SHO) model is utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the CNN-GRU model, enhancing its performance. The analysis of the CHWAIG-DLSHO method takes place utilizing AI vs. human text dataset. The performance validation of the CHWAIG-DLSHO method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.17 % over existing techniques.","Latent Dirichlet allocation, Spotted hyena optimizer, ChatGPT, Human-generated text, Artificial intelligence"

To achieve this, the Fuzzy Delphi Method FDM was adopted to systematically refine and validate the set of relevant CEPs based on expert consensus, ensuring the inclusion of the most significant CEPs. Subsequently, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory DEMATEL method was used to determine the causal relationships and influence levels among these CEPs, enabling the identification of key drivers for carbon reduction. Results show that supply chain optimization CEP20, adaptive reuse of materials CEP18, and bio-based materials CEP17 emerged as the most influential CEPs for reducing the industry's carbon footprint. Further, sensitivity analysis validated these findings' robustness, ensuring their practical application reliability. The study provides actionable insights for managers and industry stakeholders by highlighting the need for integrating CEPs into operational strategies. For example, optimizing the supply chain CEP20 can enhance material efficiency while adopting bio-based materials CEP17 encourages sustainable procurement policies. Policymakers are encouraged to develop incentives and regulatory frameworks that facilitate these transitions. By offering a structured framework, the results guide decision-makers in achieving tangible progress toward China's carbon neutrality goals, fostering both environmental sustainability and competitive advantage in the construction sector.","Circular economy practices, Decarbonization, Construction industry, FDM-DEMATEL, Emerging countries, Sensitivity analysis"
"Past, present, and future of customer engagement","Customer engagement (CE) is a marketing concept that emerged after the new millennium. Despite flourishing interest on CE among marketing academics and professionals, no review, to date, has provided a comprehensive overview of the past, present, and future trends of CE. Instead, past reviews on CE are often limited to conceptual (e.g., construct) or contextual (e.g., hospitality and tourism) insights derived using traditional review methods (e.g., descriptive) with a relatively modest review sample (e.g., tens to low hundreds), which provide a limited understanding of the field in its entirety. To address this gap, this review conducted a combination of bibliometric and thematic analyses on 861 CE articles published in 377 Scopus-indexed journals between 2006 and 2020. As a result, this review reveals the major trends in article, author, country, and journal performance, as well as the past, present, and future thematic trends of CE research, and thus, provides a one stop, state-of-the-art overview of CE that marketing scholars can rely on to position and design future CE research.","Customer engagement, Bibliometric analysis, Thematic analysis, Review, Agenda"

The framework has been developed through a theoretical synthesis of concepts from the domain theory of thanatology, and the method theories of dark tourism, dark leisure and collective memory. Six concepts of value for research into dark events are identified: commercialisation; approaches; public sphere; deviant behaviour; experiences; presence of death. The conceptual framework establishes a coherent conceptual footing for dark event research, and highlights links to established theories and methods that can be of value to future researchers in this novel area. Finally, we present an agenda for future research into dark events.","Dark events, Dark tourism, Dark leisure, Collective memory, Thanatology"
"Human-level artificial general intelligence and the possibility of a technological singularity: A reaction to Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near, and McDermott's critique of Kurzweil","An analysis of Ray Kurzweil's recent book The Singularity Is Near is given, along with Drew McDermott's recent critique. The conclusion is that Kurzweil does an excellent job of fleshing out one particular plausible scenario regarding the future of AI, in which human-level AI first arrives via human-brain emulation. McDermott's arguments against the notion of Singularity via iteratively self-improving AI, as described by Kurzweil, are considered and found wanting. However, it is pointed out that the scenario focused on by Kurzweil is not the only plausible one; and an alternative is discussed, in which human-level AI arrives first via non-human-like AI's operating virtual worlds.","Strong AI, AGI, Self-modifying software, Singularity virtual worlds, Language acquisition"
Advances in problematic usage of the internet research – A narrative review by experts from the European network for problematic usage of the internet,"Global concern about problematic usage of the internet (PUI), and its public health and societal costs, continues to grow, sharpened in focus under the privations of the COVID-19 pandemic. This narrative review reports the expert opinions of members of the largest international network of researchers on PUI in the framework of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action (CA 16207), on the scientific progress made and the critical knowledge gaps remaining to be filled as the term of the Action reaches its conclusion. A key advance has been achieving consensus on the clinical definition of various forms of PUI. Based on the overarching public health principles of protecting individuals and the public from harm and promoting the highest attainable standard of health, the World Health Organisation has introduced several new structured diagnoses into the ICD-11, including gambling disorder, gaming disorder, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder, and other unspecified or specified disorders due to addictive behaviours, alongside naming online activity as a diagnostic specifier. These definitions provide for the first time a sound platform for developing systematic networked research into various forms of PUI at global scale. Progress has also been made in areas such as refining and simplifying some of the available assessment instruments, clarifying the underpinning brain-based and social determinants, and building more empirically based etiological models, as a basis for therapeutic intervention, alongside public engagement initiatives. However, important gaps in our knowledge remain to be tackled. Principal among these include a better understanding of the course and evolution of the PUI-related problems, across different age groups, genders and other specific vulnerable groups, reliable methods for early identification of individuals at risk (before PUI becomes disordered), efficacious preventative and therapeutic interventions and ethical health and social policy changes that adequately safeguard human digital rights. The paper concludes with recommendations for achievable research goals, based on longitudinal analysis of a large multinational cohort co-designed with public stakeholders.","Problematic usage of the Internet, Behavioral addiction, Gaming disorder, Covid-19 pandemic, Impulsive, Compulsive, Patient and public involvement (PPI)"
Istanbul Gezi Park Resistance Movement as Public Engagement in the Making of Place,"Turkey has proved to be one of the fast developing countries until the end of 2013. The new intense construction activity was called “urban transformation”, for a better environment by the government, and aimed to replace the buildings that were unable to sustain earthquakes. As the transformation executed, it turned out that the buildings were functioned for excessive profit. This paper will focus on this issue in two phases. First phase exposes and spots the problems within the city of Istanbul, where author lives and documents the city as a professional photographer and artist. The second phase is an exploration on how public engagement is introduced the place-making in Istanbul. The recent Gezi Park Resistance that took place in Istanbul reflected a case of participatory, collaborative policy/place-making efforts that were able to call for people motivation to shape their lives and cities.","Urban transformation, Collective placemaking, Gezi Park movement, Public engagement"
Redefining boundaries in innovation and knowledge domains: Investigating the impact of generative artificial intelligence on copyright and intellectual property rights,"The rapid integration of generative AI (GenAI) into industries and society has prompted a re-evaluation of copyright and intellectual property rights (IPR) frameworks. GenAI's ability to produce original content using data from human-created sources raises critical ethical and legal concerns. Current copyright and IPR frameworks, designed around human authorship, are insufficient to address these challenges. This study, using a multi-perspective approach, explores GenAI's disruptive potential in replicating or transforming copyrighted materials, challenging established IPR norms. Findings highlight gaps in legislation and the opacity of GenAI platforms. To address these issues, this study presents a Dynamic Ethical Framework linked to a future global fair use policy, aiming to guide responsible GenAI development and use. By incorporating insights from domain experts, this study contextualizes emerging challenges and potential solutions within broader societal and technological trends. That said, this study calls for international collaboration and further research to reform IPR related laws and frameworks, ensuring they remain relevant and equitable in a GenAI-driven era.","ChatGPT, Generative artificial intelligence, GenAI, Generative scholar, Innovation, Intellectual property (IP) Risks, Large language models (LLMs), Misuse case analysis, Personality rights"
The Authenticity-anxiety Paradox: The Quest for Authentic Second Language Communication and Reduced Foreign Language Anxiety in Virtual Environments,"In this amplification of an earlier comparative study into technical and foreign language anxiety in a virtual environment and the traditional classroom, the authenticity of the virtual environment and of the communicative interaction that occurs within that environment stand out as a significant factors associated with reduced foreign language anxiety. Students’ feelings about the authenticity of typed text-chat and of communication with their non-player character interlocutors in the virtual environment in comparison to real world communication is highly related to the foreign language anxiety they experience: the more similar they perceive these two contexts, the more likely they are to transfer feelings of anxiety related to speaking a foreign language to the virtual environment, even though perceived similarities between the real and virtual world were found to lead to greater engagement in learning in the virtual environment.","Foreign language anxiety, second language communication, virtual environments"
Social connectedness in spatial audio calling contexts,"People often use audio-only communication to connect with others. Spatialization of audio has been previously found to improve immersion, presence, and social presence during conversations. We propose that spatial audio improves social connectedness between dyads. Participants engaged in three 8-min semi-structured conversations with an acquainted partner in three conditions: in-person communication, monaural audio communication, and spatial audio communication. Using Media Naturalness Theory as our theoretical framework, we found that the use of spatial audio benefited aspects of social connectedness. While in-person communication yielded the greatest social connectedness, spatial audio better facilitated social connectedness than traditional monaural communication. Spatial audio improved feelings of being physically in the same room and being on the same wavelength and produced more nonverbal behaviors associated with rapport building than monaural communication.","Social connectedness, Spatial audio, Media naturalness theory, Interpersonal communication"
Appetite for distraction? A systematic literature review on customer smartphone distraction,"In today’s society, the ubiquitous presence of personal smartphones has led to the phenomenon of, what we call, customer smartphone distraction (CSD). This paper introduces the concept of CSD, which occurs when an internet-connected smartphone competes for a customer’s attention during a consumption goal-oriented task or behavior. Based on a three-stage research process involving a systematic literature review and an expert opinion survey with a multi-disciplinary lens to better understand this phenomenon, we develop a conceptual framework underpinned by Cognitive – Affective Personality System (CAPS) Theory that incorporates the antecedents, contingency variables, and consequences of CSD. Our findings suggest that CSD is a complex phenomenon influenced by both environmental stimuli, such as audio and visual notifications, and internal psychological states, such as boredom and anxiety, which are interdependent factors that contribute to CSD. Interestingly, the absence of environmental stimuli alone may not reduce CSD. To deal with this issue, customers need to take responsibility for their consumption behavior, while businesses, society and policy makers can assist customers through better education and design of mobile device experiences. Overall, we highlight the need for a deeper understanding of CSD and its impact on customer behavior and well-being, and outline implications to assist researchers, practitioners, policy makers and society broadly to deal with CSD.","Distraction, Smartphone, Customer wellbeing, Systematic literature review"
Verify and trust: A multidimensional survey of zero-trust security in the age of IoT,"The zero-trust (ZT) model assumes that all users, devices, and network traffic should not considered as trusted until proven. The Zero-trust model emphasizes the importance of verifying and authenticating every user and device, and limiting access to resources based on the principle of least privilege. Under the principle of the zero-trust model, devices are granted access after they have been successfully presented with their authentication credentials and access rights based on different factors, such as user identity, device health, location, and behaviour. Access controls are then continuously evaluated and updated as user properties, locations and behaviour change. The zero-trust model can be applied in various domains (healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, government etc.) to provide a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that helps organizations to reduce risk and protect critical assets. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the zero-trust model, its principles, and its applications, as well as to propose recommendations for organizations looking to adopt this approach. We explore the major components of the zero-trust framework and their integration across different practical domains. Finally, we provide insightful discussions on open research issues within the zero-trust model in terms of the security and privacy of users and devices. This paper should help researchers and practitioners understand the importance of a zero-trust framework and adopt the zero-trust model for effective security, privacy, and resilience of their networks.","Blockchain, Zero-trust architecture, Authentication and authorization, Policy-based authorization"

Improving cache-enabled D2D communications using actor–critic networks over licensed and unlicensed spectrum,"Cache-enabled Device-to-Device (D2D) communications is an effective way to improve data sharing. User Equipment (UE)-level caching holds the potential to reduce the data traffic burden on the core network. Licensed spectrum is utilized for D2D communications, but due to spectrum scarcity, exploring unlicensed spectrum is essential to enhance network capacity. In this paper, we propose caching at the UE-level and exploit both licensed and unlicensed spectrum for optimizing throughput. First, we propose a reinforcement learning-based data caching scheme leveraging an actor–critic network to improve cache-enabled D2D communications. Besides, licensed and unlicensed spectrum are devised for D2D communications considering interference from existing cellular and Wi-Fi users. A duty cycle-based unlicensed spectrum access algorithm is employed, guaranteeing the Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) required by the users. The unlicensed spectrum is prone to data packets collisions. Therefore, Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism is utilized in conjunction with Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to alleviate both the interference and packets collision problems of the unlicensed spectrum. Extensive simulations are performed to analyze the performance gain of our proposed scheme compared to the benchmarks under different network scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate that our proposed scheme possesses the potential to optimize network performance.","D2D, Unlicensed spectrum, Caching, Reinforcement learning, Actor–critic networks, Duty cycle"
A federated learning model with the whale optimization algorithm for renewable energy prediction,"Federated prediction models for energy prosumers create a global model by combining insights from local machine learning models trained on-site without centralizing the data. For time series energy data, this collaborative approach faces challenges due to the non-IID nature of the data, variations in generation patterns, the high number of model parameters, and convergence issues, leading to poor prediction accuracy. This paper introduces a novel federated learning model, FedWOA, which uses the whale optimization algorithm to determine optimal aggregation coefficients based on the local model weight vectors by pondering the updates considering the model performance and data dimensionality construct the global shared model. To handle the non-IID data the prosumers were clustered based on the similarity of their energy profiles using K-Means. FedWOA improves the prediction quality at the prosumer site, with a 16 % average reduction of the mean absolute error compared to FedAVG while demonstrating good convergence and reduced loss.","Federated learning, Whale optimization algorithm, Renewable energy prediction, Smart grid, LSTM neural network, K-Means clustering"
The Role of Trust as the Facilitator and Contingency Factor in the Adoption of Digital Healthcare Services: A Telemedicine Context,"This article revisits the effect of trust in digital healthcare services, specifically telemedicine, as a context of heightened privacy risks. It posits that trust in a telemedicine service provider causes potential users of the telemedicine service to have confidence in the service provider, and empowers them to take responsibility for their own service adoption decision. Drawing on both the unified theory of acceptance and use of the technology and the contingency theory, this article conceptualizes trust as a contingency factor (i.e., moderator) that alters the influence of the determinants of adoption decisions that have not been examined previously in the extant literature. Based on survey data from 483 consumers, the results suggest that trust in the service provider has a positive effect on the user’s intention to use a digital healthcare service (i.e., telemedicine). Moreover, it positively moderates (i.e., strengthens) the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and online privacy concerns, but negatively moderates (i.e., weakens) the effect of the facilitating conditions on this intention.","UTAUT, telemedicine, digital healthcare service, trust, online privacy concerns, technology acceptance"
A blockchain-based anonymous reporting system with no central authority: Architecture and protocol,"Blockchain technology has emerged as a compelling field of study over the past decade. Nevertheless, certain blockchain-based protocols, particularly those reliant on permissioned blockchains, continue to be under the governance of a central authority (CA). This central authority possesses extensive control capabilities, including the facilitation of user network access, as well as the establishment, connection, and revocation of users to and from the network. Consequently, the majority of policies within these protocols are centrally administered by a singular party. This paper introduces an architectural framework and a specific protocol denoted as the “Anonymous Reporting System with No Central Authority” (ARSnCA) on a public blockchain infrastructure. This design aims to mitigate the challenges posed by untrusted privileged insiders to the ARSnCA. It is hypothesized that this approach can enhance system reliability, fault tolerance, and foster trust among network members. To eliminate the central authority, a concept termed the virtual blockchain (VBC) is implemented as an embedded permissioned blockchain within a permissionless blockchain. Following the removal of the CA, the authorities previously held by the central authority are transferred to the members of the VBC. Comparative analysis and evaluation of the ARSnCA protocol demonstrate a performance advantage, with speeds that are 62% and 92% faster than reporting protocols based on ring signatures and other protocols included in the comparison.","Anonymous reporting system, Rping signature, Secret sharing, Virtual blockchain, Whistleblowing"
"Integration of traditional, transitioning & transformative digital technologies for value co-creation in B2B: A process model","The nuanced understanding of process that firms in the B2B setting undergo for VCC and the role different types of technologies play in that process is missing. We adopted a research design that comprised of four sequential phases to address this gap. In first phase, we conducted a systematic review of literature. In second phase, we deductively developed an integrated 3 × 3 framework illustrating the usage of different types of technologies across the three stages of VCC. In third phase, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 practitioners to validate the framework. Finally, in fourth phase, we developed a process model to explain how digital technology can be leveraged in each step of VCC. The process model in the backdrop of integrated framework is novel as it codifies the individual activities of VCC and brings out the nuances involved at the interaction of the activities and stages. The findings can catalyse B2B VCC at a higher speed by establishing faster feedback loops through the integration of digital technologies in each of the process steps. The gaps in research and practice on how businesses co-creating value can iterate to get a testable product with a measurable outcome while leveraging digital technologies are discussed.","B2B, Value co-creation, Digital technology, Technology adoption, Integrated framework, Process model"
Recent advances of photolithography patterning of quantum dots for micro-display applications,"The preparation of red, green, and blue quantum dot (QD) pixelated arrays with high precision, resolution, and brightness poses a significant challenge on the development of advanced micro-displays for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality applications. Alongside the controlled synthesis of high-performance QDs, a reliable QD patterning technology is crucial in overcoming this challenge. Among the various methods available, photolithography-based patterning technologies show great potentials in producing ultra-fine QD patterns at micron scale. This review article presents the recent advancements in the field of QD patterning using photolithography techniques and explores their applications in micro-display technology. Firstly, we discuss QD patterning through photolithography techniques employing photoresist (PR), which falls into two categories: PR-assisted photolithography and photolithography of QDPR. Subsequently, direct photolithography techniques based on photo-induced crosslinking of photosensitive groups and photo-induced ligand cleavage mechanisms are thoroughly reviewed. Meanwhile, we assess the performance of QD arrays fabricated using these photolithography techniques and their integration into QD light emitting diode display devices as well as color conversion-based micro light emitting diode display devices. Lastly, we summarize the most recent developments in this field and outline future prospects.","Quantum dot, Photolithography, Patterning technology, Micro-display"
