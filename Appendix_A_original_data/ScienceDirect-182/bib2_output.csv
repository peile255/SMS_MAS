The power and potentials of Flexible Query Answering Systems: A critical and comprehensive analysis,"The popularity of chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has brought research attention to question answering systems, capable to generate natural language answers to user’s natural language queries. However, also in other kinds of systems, flexibility of querying, including but also going beyond the use of natural language, is an important feature. With this consideration in mind the paper presents a critical and comprehensive analysis of recent developments, trends and challenges of Flexible Query Answering Systems (FQASs). Flexible query answering is a multidisciplinary research field that is not limited to question answering in natural language, but comprises other query forms and interaction modalities, which aim to provide powerful means and techniques for better reflecting human preferences and intentions to retrieve relevant information. It adopts methods at the crossroad of several disciplines among which Information Retrieval (IR), databases, knowledge based systems, knowledge and data engineering, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the semantic web may be mentioned. The analysis principles are inspired by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework, characterized by a top-down process, starting with relevant keywords for the topic of interest to retrieve relevant articles from meta-sources And complementing these articles with other relevant articles from seed sources Identified by a bottom-up process. to mine the retrieved publication data a network analysis is performed Which allows to present in a synthetic way intrinsic topics of the selected publications. issues dealt with are related to query answering methods Both model-based and data-driven (the latter based on either machine learning or deep learning) And to their needs for explainability and fairness to deal with big data Notably by taking into account data veracity. conclusions point out trends and challenges to help better shaping the future of the FQAS field.","Flexible query answering, Model-based query answering, Data-driven query answering"
Synthetic human gonadal tissues for toxicology,"The process of mammalian reproduction involves the development of fertile germ cells in the testis and ovary, supported by the surrounders. Fertilization leads to embryo development and ultimately the birth of offspring inheriting parental genome information. Any disruption in this process can result in disorders such as infertility and cancer. Chemical toxicity affecting the reproductive system and embryogenesis can impact birth rates, overall health, and fertility, highlighting the need for animal toxicity studies during drug development. However, the translation of animal data to human health remains challenging due to interspecies differences. In vitro culture systems offer a promising solution to bridge this gap, allowing the study of mammalian cells in an environment that mimics the physiology of the human body. Current advances on in vitro culture systems, such as organoids, enable the development of biomaterials that recapitulate the physiological state of reproductive organs. Application of these technologies to human gonadal cells would provide effective tools for drug screening and toxicity testing, and these models would be a powerful tool to study reproductive biology and pathology. This review focuses on the 2D/3D culture systems of human primary testicular and ovarian cells, highlighting the novel approaches for in vitro study of human reproductive toxicology, specifically in the context of testis and ovary.","2D culture, 3D culture, reproductive organ, human, toxicity"

Customer engagement and social media: Revisiting the past to inform the future,"Customer engagement (CE) is a marketing concept of great importance and the rise of social media has further amplified the importance of this concept. Yet, our understanding of the progress of CE research remains limited due to the absence of a one-stop state-of-the-art overview of the concept that considers its manifestation on social media. To address this gap, we review CE research on social media since the beginning of the present millennium using the PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews. The outcome of our review reveals the antecedents, decisions, and outcomes; the theories, contexts, and methods; and the ways forward for advancing knowledge, improving representation, and enhancing rigor with respect to future research on CE and social media.","Brand engagement, Business engagement, Consumer engagement, Customer engagement, Marketing, Relationship marketing, Social media, Systematic literature review, Systematic review"
Robust integration of blockchain and explainable federated learning for automated credit scoring,"This article examines the integration of blockchain, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), especially in the context of federated learning, for credit scoring in financial sectors to improve the credit assessment process. Research shows that integration of these cutting-edge technologies is in its infancy, specifically in the areas of embracing broader data, model verification, behavioural reliability and model explainability for intelligent credit assessment. The conventional credit risk assessment process utilises historical application data. However, reliable and dynamic transactional customer data are necessary for robust credit risk evaluation in practice. Therefore, this research proposes a framework for integrating blockchain and XAI to enable automated credit decisions. The main focus is on effectively integrating multi-party, privacy-preserving decentralised learning models with blockchain technology to provide reliability, transparency, and explainability. The proposed framework can be a foundation for integrating technological solutions while ensuring model verification, behavioural reliability, and model explainability for intelligent credit assessment.","Automated credit scoring, Blockchain, Explainable artificial intelligence, Decentralised federated learning"

"Reconceptualizing online offenses: A framework for distinguishing cybercrime, cyberattacks, and cyberterrorism in the Indian legal context","From a legal standpoint, there are significant disparities in treating online offenses targeting individuals, organizations, and nation-states. These disparities arise due to influences that vary discreetly based on crucial factors such as the target, motive, or impact. This article draws upon the Information Technology Amendment Act (ITAA) of 2008 in India, analyses how these factors regulate online crimes, and thereby conducts a comprehensive analysis of current literature to differentiate cybercrime, cyberattacks, and cyberterrorism. The proposed framework includes a target-impact (intent) model to differentiate illicit online activities, complemented by a discussion on the actor-intent model, which emphasizes their treatment and implications within the legal context. The article explores the target-impact (intent) definition of cybercrime, highlighting its significance in capturing the cyber aspect and differentiating it from cyberattacks. Case studies are presented to illustrate these distinctions effectively. Furthermore, the article highlights variations in mitigation strategies, investigative protocols, punitive measures, and legal consequences corresponding to the identified classifications. Lastly, it incorporates insights from theoretical criminology and sociology, discusses how the proposed target-impact (intent) model aligns with the routine activity theory, and attempts to distinguish online crimes using the institutional theory.","Online crime, Cybercrime, Cyberattack, Cyberterrorism, Cybercrime definition, Cybercrime reporting, Cybercrime investigation, Information Technology (IT) Act"
Detecting and developing new business opportunities in society 5.0 contexts: A sociotechnical approach,"Rapid technological evolution has become a great challenge for businesses and societies due to the openness provided by new digital technologies, platforms, and infrastructure and to the impacts of these innovations on how people work and live. The concept of a super-smart society (i.e., Society 5.0) comprises a fresh way to apply these innovations, in which human beings contribute to adapting technologies to daily activities in their society and making Society 5.0 ideas applicable to different areas of each individual’s life. Digital transformation and technological innovation are basic components of this paradigm. This study sought to develop a decision-support model that can help companies structure and prioritize new business opportunities within Society 5.0 contexts. The analysis system relies on a constructivist approach that promotes debates between specialists and combinations of methodologies such as cognitive mapping and interpretive structural modeling. The results highlight the most important areas in which new business opportunities can arise, thereby demonstrating that the proposed model is a valuable tool for incorporating a future orientation into business technological innovation initiatives.","Cognitive mapping, Interpretive structural modeling (ISM), New business opportunity, Society 5.0, Technological innovation"
Modified Histogram Equalization for Improved CNN Medical Image Segmentation,"This research aims to improve the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) in medical image segmentation that will detect specific parts of the body's anatomical structures. Medical images have drawbacks, such as the image's variability, quality, and complexity. We developed image preprocessing scenarios using Histogram Equalization (HE), Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and the hybrid approaches (HE-CLAHE and CLAHE-HE). We propose CNN with image enhancement for image segmentation and evaluate its performance on Lung CT-Scan and Chest X-ray datasets, which totaled 267 and 3616 images, respectively, and had ground truth. The experimental results indicate that the optimal cumulative distribution function (CDF) value of HE is 0 to 39, and the clip limit of CLAHE is 0.01. CNN produces the best segmentation with the addition of the CLAHE-HE approach. This method can increase the accuracy by 1.23 percentage points (training) and 3.22 percentage points (testing) for Lung CT-Scan images. Meanwhile, for Chest X-ray images, the training and testing accuracy increased by 1.58 and 0.96 percentage points. In addition, the proposed medical image segmentation approach using the CNN method with CLAHE-HE obtained the values of comparative coefficients DSC (dice similarity coefficient), and SSIM (structural similarity index measurement) of only about 0.92 and 0.97, respectively.","Medical Image Segmentation, CNN, Image Enhancement, CT-Scan, X-Ray, Histogram Analysis"
"Big data, machine learning, and digital twin assisted additive manufacturing: A review","Additive manufacturing (AM) has undergone significant development over the past decades, resulting in vast amounts of data that carry valuable information. Numerous research studies have been conducted to extract insights from AM data and utilize it for optimizing various aspects such as the manufacturing process, supply chain, and real-time monitoring. Data integration into proposed digital twin frameworks and the application of machine learning techniques is expected to play pivotal roles in advancing AM in the future. In this paper, we provide an overview of machine learning and digital twin-assisted AM. On one hand, we discuss the research domain and highlight the machine-learning methods utilized in this field, including material analysis, design optimization, process parameter optimization, defect detection and monitoring, and sustainability. On the other hand, we examine the status of digital twin-assisted AM from the current research status to the technical approach and offer insights into future developments and perspectives in this area. This review paper aims to examine present research and development in the convergence of big data, machine learning, and digital twin-assisted AM. Although there are numerous review papers on machine learning for additive manufacturing and others on digital twins for AM, no existing paper has considered how these concepts are intrinsically connected and interrelated. Our paper is the first to integrate the three concepts big data, machine learning, and digital twins and propose a cohesive framework for how they can work together to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability of AM processes. By exploring latest advancements and applications within these domains, our objective is to emphasize the potential advantages and future possibilities associated with integration of these technologies in AM.","Additive manufacturing, Big data, Machine learning, Digital twin, Data-driven"
Evaluation of the alternatives of introducing electric vehicles in developing countries using Type-2 neutrosophic numbers based RAFSI model,"This study focuses on implementing electric vehicles (EVs) in developing countries where energy production is mainly based on fossil fuels. Although for these countries the environmental short-run benefits of the EVs cannot offset the short-run costs, it may still be the best option to implement the EVs as soon as possible. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the alternatives to introducing EVs to the market due to the environmental concerns that created an opportunity for some developing countries to catch up with the international competition. Therefore, we develop a case scenario to explore the decision-making process in implementing the EVs with three alternatives and twelve criteria. We solve the decision-making problem by using Type-2 neutrosophic numbers (T2NNs) based on the RAFSI (Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-intervals into a Single Interval) method. The proposed model combines the advantages of the RAFSI technique, and it applies T2NNs to address the uncertainties. The results show that the alternatives that may suspend the implementation of the EVs are inferior. Direct implementation of EVs is prioritized. The policy implications of the results are discussed in the study.","Electric vehicles, Developing countries, Renewable energies, MCDM, Neutrophic sets, RAFSI approach"
A note on the affective computing systems and machines: a classification and appraisal,"Affective computing (AfC) is a continuously growing multidisciplinary field, spanning areas from artificial intelligence, throughout engineering, psychology, education, cognitive science, to sociology. Therefore, many studies have been devoted to the aim of addressing numerous issues, regarding different facets of AfC solutions. However, there is a lack of classification of the AfC systems. This study aims to fill this gap by reviewing and evaluating the state-of-the-art studies in a qualitative manner. In this line of thinking, we put forward a threefold classification that breaks down to desktop and mobile AfC systems, and AfC machines. Moreover, we identified four types of AfC systems, based on the features extracted. In our opinion, the results of this study can serve as a guide for future affect-related research and design, on the one hand, and provide a better understanding on the role of emotions and affect in human-computer interaction, on the other hand.","Affective Computing, Artificial Emotional Intelligence, Classification, System, Machine"
Gene editing enables non-invasive in vivo PET imaging of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived liver bud organoids,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived liver cell therapies such as hepatocyte-like cells and liver organoids could provide unlimited therapeutic cells for clinical transplantation, but an inadequate understanding of their in vivo fate impedes translation. Whole body in vivo imaging could enable monitoring of transplanted cell survival and/or expansion non-invasively over time, permitting robust comparisons between emerging therapies to identify those most effective. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) is a radionuclide reporter gene facilitating whole body in vivo cell tracking by positron emission tomography (PET). We gene-edited a clinical Good Manufacturing Practice-compliant hiPSC line at the AAVS1 safe harbor locus enabling constitutive expression of a hNIS-monomeric(m)GFP fusion reporter in hiPSCs and their differentiated progeny. We confirmed reporter integration did not impact pluripotency or differentiation capacity, and radiotracer uptake capacity was retained post-differentiation. In vivo trackable liver bud (LB) organoids were generated from traceable hNIS fused to monomeric GFP (hNIS-mGFP)-hiPSCs and transplanted into healthy and liver-injured mice. LB were imaged quantitatively by 18FBF4−-PET with imaging results confirmed histologically. We report, for the first time, hNIS-mGFP-hiPSC progeny retain differentiated function and PET trackability in vivo using LB. In vivo monitoring could accelerate regenerative cell therapy development by identifying efficacious candidate cells, successful engraftment/survival strategies and addressing safety concerns.","cell tracking, hepatocyte-like cells, hiPSC, reporter gene imaging, sodium iodide symporter, gene editing, PET, regenerative medicine"

At the same time, the e-commerce industry faces various challenges. In order to fully harness the potential of this industry, it is important to identify its benefits and challenges and focus on pathways to mitigate the challenges and harness its growth. This study utilizes the Delphi approach and involves experts from the e-commerce domain to get their opinions to identify the top ten benefits, challenges, and pathways for the e-commerce industry. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) methods are subsequently, employed to prioritize the identified factors. Results of the study revealed that factors such as affordable advertising & marketing; availability and product variety; and Global reachability are the most important benefits, while technological upgradation; returns or refunds; and counterfeit products posed the greatest challenges for the industry. Government compliance check; better relationship with delivery partners; and strong data privacy and online security policies emerged as the best pathways. This study also provides valuable insights to businesses, policymakers, and researchers in the e-commerce industry on how to navigate the benefits, challenges, and pathways of this rapidly growing sector.","E-commerce, Benefits, Challenges, Pathways, Delphi, Analytic hierarchy process, Criteria importance through intercriteria correlation"
Developing and validating a scale of empowerment in using artificial intelligence for problem-solving for senior secondary and university students,"Empowerment enables students to be psychologically and affectively ready to leverage the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI). However, a theory-driven scale to extend empowerment into the use of AI for problem-solving is lacking. This study developed and validated an 11-item scale of empowerment in using AI for problem-solving (EUAIPS) based on a proposed conceptual framework that synthesises empowerment and AI-related literature. The EUAIPS scale encompasses impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness in using AI for problem-solving. We collected data from a diverse sample of Hong Kong senior secondary and university students before (N = 477) and after the course (N = 409). Results demonstrated that the EUAIPS scale with a three-factor structure had good reliability and validity. Students also felt significantly more empowered to use AI for problem-solving after a 14-h course using AI for problem-solving. These findings empirically support the affective dimension of AI literacy and show that psychological control/competence is particularly important for students to harness AI to solve problems at the affective level. This study presents a valid instrument for researchers and practitioners to measure empowerment in using AI for problem-solving and informs AI literacy curriculum designers about including learning activities to help students realise its impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness.","Artificial intelligence literacy, Empowerment, Problem-solving, Scale development, Senior secondary and university students"
Fostering consumer engagement with sustainability marketing using augmented reality (SMART): A climate change response,"As climate change concerns escalate, businesses increasingly realize the pivotal role of consumer engagement through sustainability practices in enhancing brand and firm performance. In a transformative landscape characterized by societal shifts towards environmentally conscious consumer behaviors, the re-evaluation of sustainability marketing strategies is crucial. This need is further amplified by the advent of technologies like augmented reality (AR), which are reshaping market dynamics. This study not only extends the conceptualization of sustainability marketing using AR (SMART) but also proposes a comprehensive measurement scale. This scale is designed to accurately measure consumers’ perceptions of AR-focused sustainability marketing efforts in fostering engagement. Our approach, a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, involved five studies with n = 1072 consumers across the U.S., U.K., and South Africa. We conceptualize consumers’ perceptions of sustainability marketing using AR (SMART) across six dimensions: social equity, economic development, environmental protection, ethical considerations, regulatory measures, and technological innovation. The findings not only underscore the importance of integrating sustainability practices and new-age technologies (i.e., AR to foster climate-positive consumer engagement) but also offer strategic insights that can help businesses thrive in a climate-change era and meet their sustainability objectives.","Sustainability marketing, Climate change, Climate-positive behaviors, Augmented reality, Conceptualization, Measurement"
Assessing alternatives of including social robots in urban transport using fuzzy trigonometric operators based decision-making model,"Current trends point to a not-too-distant future with qualitatively advanced interactions between humans and social robots. It is critical to consider the possibility of forming meaningful social relationships with robots when defining the future of human-robot interactions, as well as studying how these interactions will evolve to the point where humans are unable to distinguish between humans and robots in urban transportation. In this study, the advantages of using social robots in urban transportation are prioritized by using a multi-criteria decision-making tool, which consists of two consecutive stages, namely: i) a novel fuzzy sine trigonometry based on the logarithmic method of additive weights (fuzzy ST-LMAW) that is proposed to calculate the criteria weights; ii) a nonlinear fuzzy Aczel-Alsina function based the weighted aggregate sum product assessment (fuzzy ALWAS-WASPAS) that is developed to select and rank the alternatives. The proposed model enables flexible nonlinear processing of complex and uncertain information encountered in real applications. A case study is developed to rank three alternatives with twelve sub-criteria grouped into four aspects using the proposed method. The results show that the most advantageous alternative is to replace people with social robots as safety drivers in level four autonomous vehicles due to their possible impact on transportation.","Social robots, Urban transportation, Human-robot interaction, Fuzzy sets, Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), Trigonometric operators"
Linking the potentials of extended digital marketing impact and start-up growth: Developing a macro-dynamic framework of start-up growth drivers supported by digital marketing,"The contemporary market positions digital marketing as a powerful mediator between efficient digital interaction, data interpretation opportunities, and business growth, while extending its impact potential to tackle different growth challenges. As start-ups usually have limited resources and struggle with customer engagement, retention, and other growth challenges, the low investment and dynamic elements of digital marketing tools can be used to support constructive digital interactions impacting start-up growth. Consequently, these links have outlined an extended digital marketing impact in the areas which build on marketing and sales and influence growth components such as product & market testing, customer engagement, and partnership development. Through a systematic literature review, we present a holistic overview encompassing start-up growth areas that use digital marketing. We also discuss how digital marketing efforts complement the start-up maturity. Furthermore, we analyze the differences in B2B and B2C digital marketing usage and discuss how emerging technologies impact digital marketing. The link between the extended digital marketing impact, start-up challenges, and growth areas result in the identification of start-up growth drivers supported by digital marketing. We propose a Macro-Dynamic framework identifying the start-up growth drivers from product, market, team, and finance areas and digital marketing tactics connected to the identified growth drivers.","Digital marketing tools, Digital marketing extended impact, Emerging technologies, Start-up challenges, Start-up maturity, Start-up growth"
A hybrid analytical concept to QoE index evaluation: Enhancing eMBB service detection in 5G SA networks,"The launch of commercial 5G networks has unlocked numerous opportunities for heavy data users and high-speed applications. The expected requirements for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) are pushing end-users to adopt 5G optimistically. Though already deployed 5G networks have shown high data rates and very low latency, the service-based experience and application behavior have been challenging to monitor. The legacy quality of experience (QoE) and service (QoS) monitoring and evaluation techniques have shown limitations in 5G standalone networks. The current 5G deployment large amount of user plane traffic generated by end-users makes the legacy-monitoring task very costly for mobile network operators (MNOs). And the complexity of the projected future 5G architecture, including advanced technologies such as network functions virtualization (NFV), software-defined networking (SDN), and network slicing, makes traditional service detection and QoE assessment ineffective. In this paper, we discuss a cost-effective hybrid analytical approach to eMBB service detection, analysis, and perceived user QoE measurement from raw traffic in a live 5G standalone (SA) network. We first use flow-level-based packet inspection and machine learning to detect and classify eMBB services from raw traffic. We then use a statistical approach to compute the user quality index (UQI). The concept is tested on traffic captured on a fixed 5G SA network. And the output enabled the MNO to have a 5G QoE assessment structure and awareness to adjust network traffic policies.","5G standalone network, Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), Machine learning, Network functions virtualization (NFV), Service awareness, Quality of service (QoS), Quality of experience (QoE), Software-defined networks (SDN)"
The computing continuum: From IoT to the cloud,"In the era of the IoT revolution, applications are becoming ever more sophisticated and accompanied by diverse functional and non-functional requirements, including those related to computing resources and performance levels. Such requirements make the development and implementation of these applications complex and challenging. Computing models, such as cloud computing, can provide applications with on-demand computation and storage resources to meet their needs. Although cloud computing is a great enabler for IoT and endpoint devices, its limitations make it unsuitable to fulfill all design goals of novel applications and use cases. Instead of only relying on cloud computing, leveraging and integrating resources at different layers (like IoT, edge, and cloud) is necessary to form and utilize a computing continuum. The layers’ integration in the computing continuum offers a wide range of innovative services, but it introduces new challenges (e.g., monitoring performance and ensuring security) that need to be investigated. A better grasp and more profound understanding of the computing continuum can guide researchers and developers in tackling and overcoming such challenges. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive and unified view of the computing continuum. The paper discusses computing models in general with a focus on cloud computing, the computing models that emerged beyond the cloud, and the communication technologies that enable computing in the continuum. In addition, two novel reference architectures are presented in this work: one for edge–cloud computing models and the other for edge–cloud communication technologies. We demonstrate real use cases from different application domains (like industry and science) to validate the proposed reference architectures, and we show how these use cases map onto the reference architectures. Finally, the paper highlights key points that express the authors’ vision about efficiently enabling and utilizing the computing continuum in the future.","Computing continuum, Cloud computing, Fog computing, Edge computing, Mobile cloud computing, Multi-access edge computing, SDN, NFV, IoT, Use case, Reference architecture"
"Public Policies, Open Innovation Ecosystems and Innovation Performance. Analysis of the Impact of Funding and Regulations","ABSTRACT Open innovation (OI) has been implemented to develop competitive advantages based on the management of innovation with external players. As such, it is expected that the generalized adoption of OI practices needs to be nurtured by governmental public policies in order to enhance OI-based ecosystems. The role of open innovation ecosystems is known by the importance of multiple synergies among players/stakeholders, which are expected to be supported by regulations and funding to consolidate firms’ innovation results. This paper analyzes the role of regulations and funding on firms’ innovation performance using the double-hurdle estimation procedure. The results show that, in the first tier, inbound knowledge flows positively affect performance, and, in the second tier, public funds further reinforce innovation performance and fiscal and security regulations. In contrast, as regulations are perceived as barriers, they fail to impact innovation performance. With this paper, we manage to shed light on the importance of public policy funds in the support of thriving OI-based ecosystems as enhancers of firms’ innovation performance.","open innovation, regulations, funds, innovation performance, CIS, double-hurdle model, Cragg’s Tobit"
Current opportunities and challenges of immersive virtual reality for psychological research and application,"Immersive virtual reality (iVR), that is, digital stereoscopic 360° scenarios usually presented in head-mounted displays, has gained much popularity in medical, educational, and consumer contexts in the last years. Recently, psychological research started to utilize the theoretical and methodological advantages of iVR. Furthermore, understanding cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes in iVR similar to real-life is a genuinely psychological, currently understudied topic. This article briefly reviews the current application of iVR in psychological research and related disciplines. The review presents empirical evidence for opportunities and strengths (e.g., realism, experimental control, effectiveness of therapeutic and educational interventions) as well as challenges and weaknesses (e.g., differences in experiencing presence, interacting with VR content including avatars, i.e., graphical representation of a person). The main part discusses areas requiring additional basic research, such as cognitive processes, socio-emotional processes during social interactions in iVR, and possible societal implications (e.g., fraud, VR-addiction). For both research and application, iVR offers a contemporary extension of the psychological toolkit, offering new avenues to investigate and enhance core phenomena of psychology such as cognition, affect, motivation, and behavior. Still, it is crucial to exercise caution in its application as excessive and careless use of iVR can pose risks to individuals' mental and physical well-being.","Virtual reality, Cognitive processes, Socio-emotional processes, Psychotherapy, Education, Societal implications"
"Scenario-based analysis for industrial project planning in the context of carbon peaking: Case study city, China","The Chinese government is actively pursuing a low-carbon development model with a clear target of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030. This study presents a project-based perspective on CO2 emissions from the industrial sector in the city. The article quantifies and analyzes the project planning by including the entire gross industrial production value, industrial structure, energy intensity, energy structure, and CO2 emission coefficient of the industrial sector's CO2 emissions decomposition model. Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis were coupled to evaluate how the city's industrial sector could achieve its peak carbon targets by industry. The expected range of CO2 emissions from the city's industrial sector in 2025, 2030, and 2035, based on the project plan and policies in place, is projected to be between 65.64 and 69.26 Mt, 72.13–78.48 Mt, and 69.32–76.62 Mt. However, the simulations show that there are still considerable uncertainties in reaching the peak carbon target in 2030, necessitating greater government efforts. To achieve the 2030 goal for the city's industrial sector, the paper recommends that the government increase the baseline criteria for industrial structure, energy intensity, and energy structure. This study provides scientific project planning guidance for Chinese cities to successfully achieve the 2030 goal.","Carbon peaking, Project planning, Industry sector, City, Monte Carlo"
An intelligent glove interface with integrated perceptual simulation and motion tracking for enhanced virtual interactions,"Summary Emerging technologies that bridge the real and virtual worlds are pivotal for enhancing virtual interactions. Current devices, such as smart gloves, often focus solely on hand motion tracking or provide limited haptic feedback, restricting user experiences. Here, a haptic intelligent motion tracking (HIMT) glove designed for enhanced virtual interactions is proposed. The glove includes optimized electromagnetic vibrators that allow users to perceive the shapes and weights of virtual objects accurately. Additionally, graphene fiber sensors were developed for upper-limb motion tracking incorporating inertial measurement units (IMUs). Evaluations in virtual interactive physiotherapy demonstrate that the glove enhances the willingness to engage in rehabilitation training. Furthermore, users achieve a high diagnostic accuracy of 96.1% when assessing virtual patients. The HIMT glove demonstrates significant potential as a comprehensive solution for human-virtual interactions, promising wide future applications in fields such as physiotherapy, medical training, education, sports, and entertainment.","smart glove, electromagnetic vibrator, fiber sensor, motion tracking, virtual reality, physiotherapy, clinical diagnosis"
21st century progress in computing,"In the search for explanations for slower productivity growth since the mid-2000s in many countries, one possibility is a slower pace of progress in digital technologies. In this paper we show that the cost of computation has continued to decline rapidly, taking into account innovation in chip types and cloud computing. This is a continuation of its long-run trend; the decline has slowed since 2010, but not earlier. As firms use computational power along with other inputs including relevant human and organisational capital, to the extent that the productivity slowdown is linked to technology use the explanation is likely to lie in these other elements of the input bundle.","Computation, Prices, Productivity, AI, Cloud computing"

Balancing privacy and performance in federated learning: A systematic literature review on methods and metrics,"Federated learning (FL) as a novel paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ensures enhanced privacy by eliminating data centralization and brings learning directly to the edge of the user's device. Nevertheless, new privacy issues have been raised particularly during training and the exchange of parameters between servers and clients. While several privacy-preserving FL solutions have been developed to mitigate potential breaches in FL architectures, their integration poses its own set of challenges. Incorporating these privacy-preserving mechanisms into FL at the edge computing level can increase both communication and computational overheads, which may, in turn, compromise data utility and learning performance metrics. This paper provides a systematic literature review on essential methods and metrics to support the most appropriate trade-offs between FL privacy and other performance-related application requirements such as accuracy, loss, convergence time, utility, communication, and computation overhead. We aim to provide an extensive overview of recent privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL used across various applications, placing a particular focus on quantitative privacy assessment approaches in FL and the necessity of achieving a balance between privacy and the other requirements of real-world FL applications. This review collects, classifies, and discusses relevant papers in a structured manner, emphasizing challenges, open issues, and promising research directions.","Distributed artificial intelligence, Federated learning, Cybersecurity, Trustworthiness, Performance evaluation"
"Computational approaches to Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Advances in theory, applications and trends","Deep Learning (DL), a groundbreaking branch of Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a driving force in both theoretical and applied Artificial Intelligence (AI). DL algorithms, rooted in complex and non-linear artificial neural systems, excel at extracting high-level features from data. DL has demonstrated human-level performance in real-world tasks, including clinical diagnostics, and has unlocked solutions to previously intractable problems in virtual agent design, robotics, genomics, neuroimaging, computer vision, and industrial automation. In this paper, the most relevant advances from the last few years in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and several applications to neuroscience, neuroimaging, computer vision, and robotics are presented, reviewed and discussed. In this way, we summarize the state-of-the-art in AI methods, models and applications within a collection of works presented at the 9th International Conference on the Interplay between Natural and Artificial Computation (IWINAC). The works presented in this paper are excellent examples of new scientific discoveries made in laboratories that have successfully transitioned to real-life applications.","Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Data science, Computational approaches, Machine learning, Deep learning, Neuroscience, Robotics, Biomedical applications, Computer-aided diagnosis systems"
In search of better methods for the longitudinal assessment of tech-derived X-risks: How five leading scenario planning efforts can help,"This mixed methods article discusses the role of scenario analysis as a tool to assess the broadest possible specter of positive and negative effects of technologies and social processes within current existential risk assessment and research. To do so, it compares and contrasts case studies of five ongoing, longitudinal scenario planning efforts of global nature– the Shell scenarios, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the CSIS Seven Revolutions Scenarios, The Millennium Project's State of The Future, and the NIC's Global Trends 2040, to derive lessons for whether and how the adjacent existential risk (X-risk) and tech assessment communities can better deploy scenario planning methodology. Observations are derived from interviews with practitioners involved in these efforts as well as an assessment of the publicly available material issued by each project, including the scenarios produced. The emphasis is on the methodologies used, the timelines considered, the forces each identifies as important scenario drivers, and the process of engagement once scenarios are created. Three practices identified include (1) constructing narratives based on strong data, (2) sticking to plausible scenarios (not wild cards), and (3) designing a process of engagement, which each of these does well albeit in different ways. The article concludes with a few brief recommendations for future scenario planning efforts, particularly relevant for x-risk studies that aim to be relevant for tech assessment and governance. Overall, this review shows global scenario efforts aimed at influencing governance would benefit from (a) a more uniformly shared vocabulary, (b) an underlying theory of cascading systemic change, (c) deeper methodological transparency, (d) increased transdisciplinary perspectives, yet (e) maintaining scientific rigor. These improvements would particularly benefit emerging tech-risk derived X-risk scenario efforts where the stakes are the highest they could be, safeguarding humanity's future.","Forecasting, Methods, Human extinction, Global catastrophic risks (GCRs), Scenario methods, Existential risks"
Federated Learning for improved prediction of failures in Autonomous Guided Vehicles,"Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are nowadays an indispensable component of production lines in smart manufacturing. Managing the fleet of AGVs covers not only the delegation of operational tasks but also the monitoring of AGVs activity and health condition by applying tailored Machine Learning-based methods to detect anomalies in various signals gathered by edge IoT devices mounted on board. Detecting anomalies requires appropriate prediction of selected signals based on multiple types of sensor readings. Momentary energy consumption is one of the signals that can indicate abnormal states in AGVs. In this paper, we show that the prediction of this signal can be improved with the Federated Learning (FL) approach that involves exchanging experience gained by particular AGVs. This paper significantly extends the conference paper (Shubyn et al., 2022) with the new multi-round approach to building global prediction models and recent experiments on real data streams produced by AGVs designed by the AIUT company. The results of our experiments prove that in the AGV operational environments with distributed knowledge Federated Learning performs better than traditional centralized approaches and that frequent synchronization of experience may lead to better prediction quality.","Federated Learning, Autonomous Guided Vehicles, Smart manufacturing, Prediction, Industry 4.0"
"Smart-enhanced organisational functions: A framework comprising capabilities, barriers, and evolutional path","Integrating smart industrial products (SIPs) into production processes introduces new dynamics of capabilities and challenges within organisations. However, a prevalent issue is the ad hoc adoption of SIPs without a cohesive strategy, resulting in isolated solutions that do not effectively enhance core organisational functions. Our research fills this critical gap by identifying and combining the capabilities and barriers posed by SIPs. Our findings allow us to propose a framework comprising the stages each main organisational function needs to develop to move from a traditional to a completely autonomous decision-making function. This evolutional path requires that each organisational function acquires selected capabilities and overcomes specific barriers. Our approach encompasses a multi-method methodology, commencing with a systematic literature review (SLR) encompassing 44 papers, leading to the identification of 20 capabilities and 23 barriers. Subsequently, through rigorous content analyses and expert interviews, we formulate the framework. This paper contributes to academia by providing a framework with an evolutional path that main organisational functions may follow according to the capability they acquire from the SIP and which barriers should be surpassed at each level. For managers in practice, the proposed framework enables a better understanding of the stage of their operations and which capabilities will take their main organisational function from traditional (level 0) to autonomous (level 3) stages.","Barriers, Capabilities, Connected products, Smart production, Smart industrial products"
Digital Twin based Smart Manufacturing; From Design to Simulation and Optimization Schema,"The advent of new-generation information and communication technologies, such as Generative AI, Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, Blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence (AI), has led to the emergence of the era of big data in recent years. Digital twin has emerged as one of the most active components in smart manufacturing, garnering significant attention from enterprises, research institutes, and researchers. By creating a digital twin, manufacturers can simulate different scenarios and test various configurations without disrupting the actual production process. This allows for more efficient testing and optimization of production processes, as well as improved quality control and predictive maintenance. Overall, digital twins are an important tool in smart production that can help manufacturers improve efficiency and reduce costs while ensuring high-quality output. In this paper, after reviewing the literature on the subject, in this article, by reviewing the literature, we presented a framework of the digital twin in smart manufacturing, which includes Optimization, Predictive Maintenance, Quality Control, Design, and Simulation, which can be a good guide for future studies.","Digital Twin, Smart Manufacturing, Internet of Things, Predictive Maintenance, Optimization & Simulation"
"ACMSD inhibition corrects fibrosis, inflammation, and DNA damage in MASLD/MASH","Background & Aims Recent findings reveal the importance of tryptophan-initiated de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis in the liver, a process previously considered secondary to biosynthesis from nicotinamide. The enzyme α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, acts as a modulator of de novo NAD+ synthesis. Boosting NAD+ levels has previously demonstrated remarkable metabolic benefits in mouse models. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic implications of ACMSD inhibition in the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/steatohepatitis (MASLD/MASH). Methods In vitro experiments were conducted in primary rodent hepatocytes, Huh7 human liver carcinoma cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human liver organoids (HLOs). C57BL/6J male mice were fed a western-style diet and housed at thermoneutrality to recapitulate key aspects of MASLD/MASH. Pharmacological ACMSD inhibition was given therapeutically, following disease onset. HLO models of steatohepatitis were used to assess the DNA damage responses to ACMSD inhibition in human contexts. Results Inhibiting ACMSD with a novel specific pharmacological inhibitor promotes de novo NAD+ synthesis and reduces DNA damage ex vivo, in vivo, and in HLO models. In mouse models of MASLD/MASH, de novo NAD+ biosynthesis is suppressed, and transcriptomic DNA damage signatures correlate with disease severity; in humans, Mendelian randomization-based genetic analysis suggests a notable impact of genomic stress on liver disease susceptibility. Therapeutic inhibition of ACMSD in mice increases liver NAD+ and reverses MASLD/MASH, mitigating fibrosis, inflammation, and DNA damage, as observed in HLO models of steatohepatitis. Conclusions Our findings highlight the benefits of ACMSD inhibition in enhancing hepatic NAD+ levels and enabling genomic protection, underscoring its therapeutic potential in MASLD/MASH. Impact and implications Enhancing NAD+ levels has been shown to induce remarkable health benefits in mouse models of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/steatohepatitis (MASLD/MASH), yet liver-specific NAD+ boosting strategies remain underexplored. Here, we present a novel pharmacological approach to enhance de novo synthesis of NAD+ in the liver by inhibiting α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), an enzyme highly expressed in the liver. Inhibiting ACMSD increases NAD+ levels, enhances mitochondrial respiration, and maintains genomic stability in hepatocytes ex vivo and in vivo. These molecular benefits prevent disease progression in both mouse and human liver organoid models of steatohepatitis. Our preclinical study identifies ACMSD as a promising target for MASLD/MASH management and lays the groundwork for developing ACMSD inhibitors as a clinical treatment.","NAD, ACMSD, DNA repair, MASLD/MASH, Mendelian randomization, human liver organoids"
Hedging with automatic liquidation and leverage selection on bitcoin futures,"Bitcoin derivatives positions are maintained with a self-selected margin, which is often too low to avoid automatic liquidation by the exchange, without notice, especially during periods of excessive volatility. Indeed, according to CryptoQuant, almost $80 billion of positions on centralised exchanges were liquidated during 2021, that is an average of over $200 million per day. So hedgers of bitcoin price risk should account for the possibility of automatic liquidation when taking positions on bitcoin futures. We derive a semi-closed form for an optimal hedging strategy with dual objectives – to minimize both the variance of the hedged portfolio and the probability of liquidation due to insufficient collateral. The solution depends on the statistical characteristics of the spot and futures extreme returns, and other parameters that characterize the hedger by choice of leverage, loss aversion and collateral management. An empirical analysis based on minute-level data compares the performance of the major direct and inverse bitcoin hedging instruments traded on five major exchanges.","Finance, Cryptocurrency, Leverage, Liquidation, Perpetual swap"
CrowdRouting: Trustworthy and customized cross-domain routing based on crowdsourcing,"Cross-domain routing in Integrated Heterogeneous Networks (Inte-HetNet) should ensure efficient and secure data transmission across different network domains by satisfying diverse routing requirements. However, current solutions face numerous challenges in continuously ensuring trustworthy routing, fulfilling diverse requirements, achieving reasonable resource allocation, and safeguarding against malicious behaviors of network operators. We propose CrowdRouting, a novel cross-domain routing scheme based on crowdsourcing, dedicated to establishing sustained trust in cross-domain routing, comprehensively considering and fulfilling various customized routing requirements, while ensuring reasonable resource allocation and effectively curbing malicious behavior of network operators. Concretely, CrowdRouting employs blockchain technology to verify the trustworthiness of border routers in different network domains, thereby establishing sustainable and trustworthy cross-domain routing based on sustained trust in these routers. In addition, CrowdRouting ingeniously integrates a crowdsourcing mechanism into the auction for routing, achieving fair and impartial allocation of routing rights by flexibly embedding various customized routing requirements into each auction phase. Moreover, CrowdRouting leverages incentive mechanisms and routing settlement to encourage network domains to actively participate in cross-domain routing, thereby promoting optimal resource allocation and efficient utilization. Furthermore, CrowdRouting introduces a supervisory agency (e.g., undercover agent) to effectively suppress the malicious behavior of network operators through the game and interaction between the agent and the network operators. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing works, we demonstrate that CrowdRouting excels in providing trustworthy and fine-grained customized routing services, stimulating active participation in cross-domain routing, inhibiting malicious operator behavior, and maintaining reasonable resource allocation, all of which outperform baseline schemes.","Trustworthy routing, Cross-domain routing, Customized routing, Crowdsourcing"
"Human versus virtual influences, a comparative study","Influencer marketing aims to promote brands and influence consumer decisions, and recent technological advances have created options for non-human, virtual influencers. Such developments suggest the need to determine whether the effects of virtual influencers on consumer decisions differ from those of human influencers, depending on the type of product they are promoting. With a 2 (virtual vs. human influencer) × 2 (utilitarian vs. hedonic product) experimental design, using Instagram influencer posts and data from 275 participants, the current research establishes that the type of influencer does not affect intentions to adopt recommendations. But the influence process varies by type of influencer: Virtual influencers’ recommendations appear more useful, especially for utilitarian products, but consumers identify more with human influencers’ posts. Both usefulness and identification increase intention to adopt influencers’ recommendation. Overall, these results suggest that, while virtual influencers should endorse utilitarian products, human influencers should be hired to endorse hedonic products.","Virtual influencer, Human influencer, Identification, Usefulness, Behavioral intention, Type of product"
Exploring the effect of VR-enhanced teaching aids in STEAM education: An embodied cognition perspective,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of Physical Teaching Aids (PTAs) and VR-Enhanced Teaching Aids (VETAs) on students’ learning performance, attitudes, and classroom interactions in a STEAM course. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a total of 85 fifth-grade students, 42 in the treatment group and 43 in the control group. The students in the treatment group reported a high level of acceptance of the VETAs in the post-course interview. The Lag Sequential Analysis results indicated that the use of VETAs improved students' learning performance and made the classroom more learner-centered than those who were facilitated with PTAs. In the treatment group, students were able to investigate problems more actively, practice and innovate more interactively, and achieve deeper learning. The current study further elaborates on the reasons and summarizes the mechanism of VETAs supporting the perceptual field in STEAM education.","Perceptual field, STEAM education, VR-Enhanced teaching aids (VETAs)"
Decentralization illusion in Decentralized Finance: Evidence from tokenized voting in MakerDAO polls,"Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is very popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications as it provides a decentralized governance solution through blockchain. We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.","decentralized finance, blockchain, tokens, governance"
"A survey on semantic communications: Technologies, solutions, applications and challenges","Semantic Communication (SC) has emerged as a novel communication paradigm that provides a receiver with meaningful information extracted from the source to maximize information transmission throughput in wireless networks, beyond the theoretical capacity limit. Despite the extensive research on SC, there is a lack of comprehensive survey on technologies, solutions, applications, and challenges for SC. In this article, the development of SC is first reviewed and its characteristics, architecture, and advantages are summarized.

Applications of SC to UAV communication, remote image sensing and fusion, intelligent transportation, and healthcare are also presented and their strategies are summarized. Finally, some challenges and future research directions are presented to provide guidance for further research of SC.","Semantic communication, Semantic coding, Semantic extraction, Semantic communication framework, Semantic communication applications"
Simplifying Crowd Automation in the Virtual Laboratory of Archaeology,"Virtual archaeology projects have been evolving to go beyond a mere reconstruction of architecture and artefacts of heritage sites: human interaction with the environment is also an object of research for historians and archaeologists. Methodologies like the London Charter propose that historians and archaeologists, in close collaboration with technical teams, lead virtual archaeology projects to guarantee the credibility and scientific validation of the result. The question is how to allow historians to model crowds on their own, if lacking the required skills to programme complex artificial intelligent-driven autonomous agents. In this article a method is proposed, currently under development, to allow non-programmers will be able to successfully model crowds using very simple tools that do not require formal programming knowledge but can still provide convincing results. The underlying idea is to employ concepts borrowed from computer games, whose interfaces are targeted to non-experts and adapt them to the specificities of virtual world platforms like Second Life® and OpenSimulator. Moreover, some limitations and ideas for further extension are discussed.","Second Life, OpenSimulator, Artifircial intelligence, Virtual archaeology, Genetic algorithms, Bots"
Human-centric assembly in smart factories,"Assembly in future smart factories needs to address three challenges, including human centricity, sustainability, and resilience. Conventional approaches for automation in assembly have reached a bottleneck in terms of operation automomy, leaving various tasks to continued manual labour by human operators. To ease the burden on humans both physically and intellectually, human-centric assembly enhanced by augmented robots, cognitive systems, mixed reality and collaborative intelligence, assisted by thought-driven brain robotic controls, provides a promising solution. Within the context, this keynote provides an in-depth analysis of the state of human-centric assembly and identifies potentially fruitful research directions in future smart factories.","Assembly, Robot, Human-centricity"
"Digital technologies and carbon neutrality goals: An in-depth investigation of drivers, barriers, and risk mitigation strategies","Prior research has primarily concentrated on non-digital and process-oriented methods for achieving carbon neutrality (CN) in the context of mitigating climate change (CC), while the potential of digital technology (DT) has hardly been investigated. This study addresses this gap by answering four research questions: How are firms utilizing DT to achieve CN? What drives the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What are the barriers that prevent the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What risk mitigation strategies can be adopted by firms to overcome these barriers? An inductive method using open-ended essays has been adopted to gather data from firms that have already implemented DT for CN. The findings revealed four distinct dimensions. Utilization of DT for CN includes enhancing business value, managing one's carbon footprint, enabling smart solutions, and enhancing efficiency. The drivers for adopting DT for CN included driving business growth, external pressures, competitive advantage, and environmental consciousness. Key barriers included financial barriers, technological barriers, human resource barriers, and external barriers. Risk mitigation strategies included pre-implementation strategies, detailed planning and evaluation, ensuring employees' buy-in and readiness, and external stakeholder engagement. This study offers a broad-based foundation for designing DT strategies for achieving CN.",", , , , , , ,"
Enhanced Dynamic Deep Q-Network for Federated Learning scheduling policies on IoT devices using explanation-driven trust,"Recent advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing have led to rapid growth in the number of IoT devices generating extensive volumes of data at the network edge. Efficiently scheduling tasks on these devices, particularly under strict latency constraints in federated learning (FL) environments, poses substantial challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-energy-aware scheduling framework specifically designed for latency-constrained federated edge computing scenarios. Our innovative strategy integrates Dynamic Deep Q-Network (Dynamic-DQN) reinforcement learning with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabling dynamic, real-time assessment of device trustworthiness with interpretability and transparency. This combined approach allows the framework to intelligently allocate tasks to IoT devices, explicitly optimizing for reduced latency, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced system reliability. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that our proposed method substantially outperforms conventional reinforcement learning and heuristic scheduling algorithms, demonstrating significant reductions in latency, superior energy management, and improved scalability. These results underscore the robustness and practical effectiveness of our framework in addressing critical FL challenges.","Internet of Things (IoT), Edge computing, Federated learning (FL), Trust, Task scheduling, Dynamic Deep Q-Network (Dynamic-DQN), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)"
Self-proximity in augmented reality enhances consumer’s responses to green products through anticipated warm glow,"Encouraging online green purchasing requires overcoming the abstract nature of e-commerce and making the environmental benefits of green products more tangible. Augmented reality (AR) is a promising tool that allows consumers to try on green products virtually, fostering self-proximity—the perception that the augmented self-representation is close to oneself. We explore how and under what conditions AR-enabled self-proximity enhances consumer responses to green products. We find that AR-enabled self-proximity enhances the personal relevance of green products, heightens the anticipated warm glow, and improves consumer responses to green products. AR is particularly effective in promoting green purchasing because it heightens anticipated warm glow, which in turn leads to higher purchase intentions for green products than for generic ones. We highlight the need to carefully design AR experiences that emphasize self-relevance and intrinsic rewards to maximize impact, offer practical recommendations, and suggest avenues for future research in this growing area of study.","Green product, Augmented reality, Anticipated warm glow, E-commerce, Sustainability, Construal-level theory"
Dynamic digital capabilities and supply chain resilience: The role of government effectiveness,"Organizations in recent times are increasingly investing in building supply chain resilience following disruptions due to natural disasters, geo-political crises, and pandemics. A lack of government support has exacerbated the disruption to supply chains in some regions of the world. The positive influence of digitalization on social inclusion, government accountability, and creating a more open environment is well understood. Despite this, different countries have shown varying degrees of digital responsiveness during the pandemic as they attempted to deal with the effects of various COVID strains. The influence of government policies on the supply chain has not been examined in the literature so far and, hence, to address this research gap, we examine the interaction effect of government support effectiveness i.e., tax credits, interest deferral, digital investment, soft loans on dynamic capabilities i.e., digital adaptabilities and digital agilities and on supply chain resilience, using a multi-method approach. To understand how digital adaptability and agility improve supply chain resilience, we conducted 13 semi-structured interviews. Additionally, we pretested our measurement instrument using qualitative semi-structured interviews to validate our hypothesized relationships. We collected data at a specific point of time using a survey-based instrument (N = 203) to address our research questions. Based on data analyses of both the qualitative and survey-based data, our findings indicate that digital adaptability is an important driver of digital agility. Furthermore, the results indicate that government effectiveness is crucial to enhancing supply chain resilience by enhancing digital adaptability and agility. Our research makes some useful contributions to the dynamic capability view by enhancing theoretical understanding, of the role of government in building digital capabilities in uncertain times, to improve supply chain resilience. It also bridges the research gaps between macro and micro perspectives, as identified by management scholars. Lastly, we noted the weaknesses and limitations in the study and therefore we have offered multiple research directions forward, that could help researchers to further develop our current work.","Digital agility, Digital adaptability, Dynamic capability, Government effectiveness, Supply chain resilience"
"Decentralized project delivery on the crypto commons: Conceptualization, governance mechanisms, and future research directions","This paper presents a first conceptualization for decentralized project delivery through the combination of blockchain technology and common pool resource governance theory, also known as the ”crypto commons”. While previous literature on project delivery models identifies the use of decentralized governance, there is not yet a holistic conceptualization nor a specific overview of governance applications that can be applied. To develop the concept, we use a literature review to synthesize fourteen blockchain governance mechanisms useful for managing the crypto-commons. Subsequently, we use systematic combining to identify twenty-two specific applications for decentralized project delivery in the construction industry, one of the largest project-based industries. Each application is briefly reviewed, and examples of their relevance to realize decentralized project delivery models are provided. We discuss the potential for novel forms of project delivery, but also the need for future research on the applications, as well as on the system level implications, the system design challenges, and the implementation barriers in the specific context of the construction industry. Overall, the concepts and mechanisms presented provide a theoretical foundation upon which future researchers can use to design novel decentralized project delivery models.","Blockchain, Commons, Common pool resources, Integrated project delivery, Collaborative project delivery, Smart contracts, DAO"
Leveraging on cultural and creative industries to foster social innovation: A bibliometric analysis,"This study investigated the interplay between community-based cultural initiatives conducted by Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) and social innovation. Selecting peer-reviewed open-access articles that focus on the intersection of culture and innovation was the first step in our systematic literature review. Our analysis focused on the 76 most cited papers that included the keywords ‘community-led local development’, ‘social innovation’, and ‘cultural and creative industries’. The literature review revealed that CCIs can significantly promote social innovation through cultural engagement, particularly when they collaborate with various stakeholders. However, researchers differ in their emphasis on the nature of collaboration. Some argue that partnerships with businesses or academic institutions are essential for creating ‘heterogeneous sources of knowledge’ (HSK). Others contend that collaboration between government entities and local authorities is vital for fostering regional and local development. The third perspective introduces the notion of ‘entrepreneurial co-creation’, suggesting that CCIs work alongside stakeholders with technical and managerial expertise. Finally, there is a consensus that CCIs need to acquire new leadership skills and competencies to ensure sustainability and resilience. By synthesising these four perspectives, this study offers a comprehensive framework that positions CCIs at the core of a broader economic, territorial, managerial, and political context.","Social innovation, Culture, Cultural and creative industries, Participation, People-led"
Embracing entrepreneurship in the creator economy: The rise of creatrepreneurs,"The creator economy has led to profound transformations in the way that individuals—content creators—produce and deliver digital content, how they create and appropriate value from such content, and how they grow careers in venturing such content creation. However, despite the industry’s economic significance, the conceptualization of content creators as entrepreneurs remains underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by exploring creators from an entrepreneurial perspective along a creatrepreneur model. Based on an extensive review of academic research, industry reports, as well as eight expert interviews with diverse stakeholders within the creator economy ecosystem, the article defines the scope of creators’ entrepreneurial activities, offers a taxonomy of creator venture models, and develops a framework of key drivers of entrepreneurial success within the creator economy, encompassing both environmental and individual success factors. Building on this conceptualization, this paper further identifies potential avenues for future research in the creator economy, focusing on entrepreneurial strategies in building creator ventures and evaluating their key success factors, and concludes by highlighting empirical challenges in exploring these directions.","Creator economy, Content creators, Influencers, Entrepreneurship, Startups, New ventures, Digital ventures"

Asian diversity in human immune cells,"Summary The relationships of human diversity with biomedical phenotypes are pervasive yet remain understudied, particularly in a single-cell genomics context. Here, we present the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas (AIDA), a multi-national single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) healthy reference atlas of human immune cells. AIDA comprises 1,265,624 circulating immune cells from 619 donors, spanning 7 population groups across 5 Asian countries, and 6 controls. Though population groups are frequently compared at the continental level, we found that sub-continental diversity, age, and sex pervasively impacted cellular and molecular properties of immune cells. These included differential abundance of cell neighborhoods as well as cell populations and genes relevant to disease risk, pathogenesis, and diagnostics. We discovered functional genetic variants influencing cell-type-specific gene expression, which were under-represented in non-Asian populations, and helped contextualize disease-associated variants. AIDA enables analyses of multi-ancestry disease datasets and facilitates the development of precision medicine efforts in Asia and beyond.","genomics, genetics, single-cell RNA sequencing, human diversity, sub-continental diversity, genetic diversity, immune cells, healthy baseline, eQTL, precision medicine"

The Tong Test: Evaluating Artificial General Intelligence Through Dynamic Embodied Physical and Social Interactions,"The release of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series has brought artificial general intelligence (AGI) to the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) field once again. However, the questions of how to define and evaluate AGI remain unclear. This perspective article proposes that the evaluation of AGI should be rooted in dynamic embodied physical and social interactions (DEPSI). More specifically, we propose five critical characteristics to be considered as AGI benchmarks and suggest the Tong test as an AGI evaluation system. The Tong test describes a value- and ability-oriented testing system that delineates five levels of AGI milestones through a virtual environment with DEPSI, allowing for infinite task generation. We contrast the Tong test with classical AI testing systems in terms of various aspects and propose a systematic evaluation system to promote standardized, quantitative, and objective benchmarks and evaluation of AGI.","Artificial general intelligence, Artificial intelligence benchmark, Artificial intelligence evaluation, Embodied artificial intelligence, Value alignment, Turing test, Causality"
A spatiotemporal intelligent framework and experimental platform for urban digital twins,"Backgrounds This work emphasizes the current research status of the urban Digital Twins to establish an intelligent spatiotemporal framework.

The emergence of triboelectric sensors presents avenues to meet these demands. This study introduces an approach by integrating smart thermosensitive triboelectric nanosensors into a robotic platform, which facilitates material recognition through the contact electrification process. Equipped with self-powered tactile awareness, the robotic fingers provide accurate material identification through the “touch and sense” mechanism. The sensor features micropyramidal structures in Ecoflex-based encapsulation layers, with NaCl solution as the electrolyte conductor. This configuration enhances stretchability and sustains sensitivity. Moreover, due to the multifunctional sensing capability of the self-powered thermosensitive sensors, this can be utilized in bionic prosthesis systems as receptors. The integration of robotics with self-powered thermosensitive sensors can be employed as cost-effective automated sensing, aiding material identification.","triboelectric, material identification, thermosensitive, robotic hand, automated temperature sensing, self-powered sensor, smart robotic sensor, work function, machine learning, internet of things, tactile sensing, triboelectric series"

Public libraries as a partner in digital innovation project: Designing a virtual reality experience to support digital literacy,"We introduce a project titled as Our Shared Virtual World which aims at increasing public libraries’ capability to provide knowledge on digital technology to general public. The practical goal of the project has been to produce a functional prototype of a virtual reality (VR) application that could be utilized freely in all the public libraries in Finland. In many countries worldwide, libraries’ role is expanding from providers of traditional books to providers of information technologies and related new forms of literacy, and this development provides the broader backdrop for the project. The contribution of the article is two-fold: First, we describe how an immersive VR application can be collaboratively developed within this specific research context, namely within a network of public libraries, and introduce the tangible outcome of the project, the VR application called Forest Elf. Secondly, we scrutinize how results of such a design work can be sustained over time: through participatory design (PD), we aimed at creating conditions which would enable public libraries to continue developing and using the artefact also after the project. We provide insights on how to tackle the challenge of research prototypes ending up being abandoned, and what factors in the context of library partnership support or hamper sustainable digital innovation — digital innovation that is inclusive and equitable but also has a long-lasting impact.","Public libraries, Participatory design, Virtual reality, Digital literacy, Digital social innovation, Research-through-design"
"Transformative marketing in the new normal: A novel practice-scholarly integrative review of business-to-business marketing mix challenges, opportunities, and solutions","Transformative marketing has been heralded as the future of marketing. While the initial catalyst for transformative marketing was the desire of customers for more meaningful engagement, the global impact of great crises (or mega disruptions) has accelerated the evolution of transformative marketing. With a focus on business-to-business (B2B) marketing, this article aims to offer transformative marketing insights to support B2B marketers in preparing for, navigating in, and recovering from great crises using the great lockdown that transpired during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a case. To do so, this article employs the marketing mix as an organizing framework and performs an integrative review of practice and scholarly articles relating to B2B marketing and COVID-19. In doing so, this article delivers a seminal integrative review that is informed by both practice and scholarly sources in B2B marketing, thereby establishing its methodological novelty and value. More importantly, this article highlights “what” is necessary and “how” B2B marketers can (re)configure the product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence elements of their marketing activities to steer their B2B marketing operations toward success in a world where global crises are a commonplace. Therefore, this article contributes in two major ways: the first from a theoretical perspective, by extending the theoretical generalizability of transformative marketing, and the second from a managerial standpoint, by shedding light on practitioner issues and offering practical suggestions for B2B marketers to prepare for, navigate in, and recover from great crises in the new normal.","Business-to-business, B2B, Coronavirus, COVID-19, Crisis, Great crises, Disruption, Mega disruption, Lockdown, Integrative review, Marketing mix, New normal, Practice, Scholarly, Transformative marketing"
Classification of human-written and AI-generated sentences using a hybrid CNN-GRU model optimized by the spotted hyena algorithm,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in generating human-like text poses significant challenges in distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated content. Recent advancements in natural language generation have significantly enhanced the quality and variety of AI-generated text, making it almost indistinguishable from human-written content. ChatGPT, a popular AI model, belongs to the generative pre-trained transformer family. While human content is created with a clear intent to convey meaning, AI-generated text aims to replicate human-like language. Classifying human-written and AI-generated sentences is crucial for addressing issues like fake news, plagiarism, and spamming. AI text often follows repetitive patterns, while human writing is more creative and original, making detection significant for combating misinformation. Therefore, this study proposes to classify human-written and AI-generated sentences using a hybrid CNN-GRU model optimized by the Spotted Hyena Algorithm (CHWAIG-DLSHO) approach. The approach involves preprocessing text data through tokenization, lemmatization, and data splitting, followed by word embedding using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). A hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is employed for sentence classification. The spotted hyena optimizer (SHO) model is utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the CNN-GRU model, enhancing its performance. The analysis of the CHWAIG-DLSHO method takes place utilizing AI vs. human text dataset. The performance validation of the CHWAIG-DLSHO method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.17 % over existing techniques.","Latent Dirichlet allocation, Spotted hyena optimizer, ChatGPT, Human-generated text, Artificial intelligence"

Therefore, this study aims to examine the role of Circular Economy Practices CEPs in decarbonizing the Chinese construction industry by identifying and prioritizing the most impactful strategies. To achieve this, the Fuzzy Delphi Method FDM was adopted to systematically refine and validate the set of relevant CEPs based on expert consensus, ensuring the inclusion of the most significant CEPs. Subsequently, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory DEMATEL method was used to determine the causal relationships and influence levels among these CEPs, enabling the identification of key drivers for carbon reduction. Results show that supply chain optimization CEP20, adaptive reuse of materials CEP18, and bio-based materials CEP17 emerged as the most influential CEPs for reducing the industry's carbon footprint. Further, sensitivity analysis validated these findings' robustness, ensuring their practical application reliability. The study provides actionable insights for managers and industry stakeholders by highlighting the need for integrating CEPs into operational strategies. For example, optimizing the supply chain CEP20 can enhance material efficiency while adopting bio-based materials CEP17 encourages sustainable procurement policies. Policymakers are encouraged to develop incentives and regulatory frameworks that facilitate these transitions. By offering a structured framework, the results guide decision-makers in achieving tangible progress toward China's carbon neutrality goals, fostering both environmental sustainability and competitive advantage in the construction sector.","Circular economy practices, Decarbonization, Construction industry, FDM-DEMATEL, Emerging countries, Sensitivity analysis"
"Past, present, and future of customer engagement","Customer engagement (CE) is a marketing concept that emerged after the new millennium. Despite flourishing interest on CE among marketing academics and professionals, no review, to date, has provided a comprehensive overview of the past, present, and future trends of CE. Instead, past reviews on CE are often limited to conceptual (e.g., construct) or contextual (e.g., hospitality and tourism) insights derived using traditional review methods (e.g., descriptive) with a relatively modest review sample (e.g., tens to low hundreds), which provide a limited understanding of the field in its entirety. To address this gap, this review conducted a combination of bibliometric and thematic analyses on 861 CE articles published in 377 Scopus-indexed journals between 2006 and 2020. As a result, this review reveals the major trends in article, author, country, and journal performance, as well as the past, present, and future thematic trends of CE research, and thus, provides a one stop, state-of-the-art overview of CE that marketing scholars can rely on to position and design future CE research.","Customer engagement, Bibliometric analysis, Thematic analysis, Review, Agenda"
Conceptualising dark events: A new framework,"Dark events are organised events linked to death, disaster and suffering, and this conceptual study provides a new framework that can be used in their analysis. The framework has been developed through a theoretical synthesis of concepts from the domain theory of thanatology, and the method theories of dark tourism, dark leisure and collective memory. Six concepts of value for research into dark events are identified: commercialisation; approaches; public sphere; deviant behaviour; experiences; presence of death. The conceptual framework establishes a coherent conceptual footing for dark event research, and highlights links to established theories and methods that can be of value to future researchers in this novel area. Finally, we present an agenda for future research into dark events.","Dark events, Dark tourism, Dark leisure, Collective memory, Thanatology"
"Human-level artificial general intelligence and the possibility of a technological singularity: A reaction to Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near, and McDermott's critique of Kurzweil","An analysis of Ray Kurzweil's recent book The Singularity Is Near is given, along with Drew McDermott's recent critique. The conclusion is that Kurzweil does an excellent job of fleshing out one particular plausible scenario regarding the future of AI, in which human-level AI first arrives via human-brain emulation. McDermott's arguments against the notion of Singularity via iteratively self-improving AI, as described by Kurzweil, are considered and found wanting. However, it is pointed out that the scenario focused on by Kurzweil is not the only plausible one; and an alternative is discussed, in which human-level AI arrives first via non-human-like AI's operating virtual worlds.","Strong AI, AGI, Self-modifying software, Singularity virtual worlds, Language acquisition"
Advances in problematic usage of the internet research – A narrative review by experts from the European network for problematic usage of the internet,"Global concern about problematic usage of the internet (PUI), and its public health and societal costs, continues to grow, sharpened in focus under the privations of the COVID-19 pandemic. This narrative review reports the expert opinions of members of the largest international network of researchers on PUI in the framework of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action (CA 16207), on the scientific progress made and the critical knowledge gaps remaining to be filled as the term of the Action reaches its conclusion. A key advance has been achieving consensus on the clinical definition of various forms of PUI. Based on the overarching public health principles of protecting individuals and the public from harm and promoting the highest attainable standard of health, the World Health Organisation has introduced several new structured diagnoses into the ICD-11, including gambling disorder, gaming disorder, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder, and other unspecified or specified disorders due to addictive behaviours, alongside naming online activity as a diagnostic specifier. These definitions provide for the first time a sound platform for developing systematic networked research into various forms of PUI at global scale. Progress has also been made in areas such as refining and simplifying some of the available assessment instruments, clarifying the underpinning brain-based and social determinants, and building more empirically based etiological models, as a basis for therapeutic intervention, alongside public engagement initiatives. However, important gaps in our knowledge remain to be tackled. Principal among these include a better understanding of the course and evolution of the PUI-related problems, across different age groups, genders and other specific vulnerable groups, reliable methods for early identification of individuals at risk (before PUI becomes disordered), efficacious preventative and therapeutic interventions and ethical health and social policy changes that adequately safeguard human digital rights. The paper concludes with recommendations for achievable research goals, based on longitudinal analysis of a large multinational cohort co-designed with public stakeholders.","Problematic usage of the Internet, Behavioral addiction, Gaming disorder, Covid-19 pandemic, Impulsive, Compulsive, Patient and public involvement (PPI)"

The new intense construction activity was called “urban transformation”, for a better environment by the government, and aimed to replace the buildings that were unable to sustain earthquakes. As the transformation executed, it turned out that the buildings were functioned for excessive profit. This paper will focus on this issue in two phases. First phase exposes and spots the problems within the city of Istanbul, where author lives and documents the city as a professional photographer and artist. The second phase is an exploration on how public engagement is introduced the place-making in Istanbul. The recent Gezi Park Resistance that took place in Istanbul reflected a case of participatory, collaborative policy/place-making efforts that were able to call for people motivation to shape their lives and cities.","Urban transformation, Collective placemaking, Gezi Park movement, Public engagement"
Redefining boundaries in innovation and knowledge domains: Investigating the impact of generative artificial intelligence on copyright and intellectual property rights,"The rapid integration of generative AI (GenAI) into industries and society has prompted a re-evaluation of copyright and intellectual property rights (IPR) frameworks. GenAI's ability to produce original content using data from human-created sources raises critical ethical and legal concerns. Current copyright and IPR frameworks, designed around human authorship, are insufficient to address these challenges. This study, using a multi-perspective approach, explores GenAI's disruptive potential in replicating or transforming copyrighted materials, challenging established IPR norms. Findings highlight gaps in legislation and the opacity of GenAI platforms. To address these issues, this study presents a Dynamic Ethical Framework linked to a future global fair use policy, aiming to guide responsible GenAI development and use. By incorporating insights from domain experts, this study contextualizes emerging challenges and potential solutions within broader societal and technological trends. That said, this study calls for international collaboration and further research to reform IPR related laws and frameworks, ensuring they remain relevant and equitable in a GenAI-driven era.","ChatGPT, Generative artificial intelligence, GenAI, Generative scholar, Innovation, Intellectual property (IP) Risks, Large language models (LLMs), Misuse case analysis, Personality rights"
The Authenticity-anxiety Paradox: The Quest for Authentic Second Language Communication and Reduced Foreign Language Anxiety in Virtual Environments,"In this amplification of an earlier comparative study into technical and foreign language anxiety in a virtual environment and the traditional classroom, the authenticity of the virtual environment and of the communicative interaction that occurs within that environment stand out as a significant factors associated with reduced foreign language anxiety. Students’ feelings about the authenticity of typed text-chat and of communication with their non-player character interlocutors in the virtual environment in comparison to real world communication is highly related to the foreign language anxiety they experience: the more similar they perceive these two contexts, the more likely they are to transfer feelings of anxiety related to speaking a foreign language to the virtual environment, even though perceived similarities between the real and virtual world were found to lead to greater engagement in learning in the virtual environment.","Foreign language anxiety, second language communication, virtual environments"
Social connectedness in spatial audio calling contexts,"People often use audio-only communication to connect with others. Spatialization of audio has been previously found to improve immersion, presence, and social presence during conversations. We propose that spatial audio improves social connectedness between dyads. Participants engaged in three 8-min semi-structured conversations with an acquainted partner in three conditions: in-person communication, monaural audio communication, and spatial audio communication. Using Media Naturalness Theory as our theoretical framework, we found that the use of spatial audio benefited aspects of social connectedness. While in-person communication yielded the greatest social connectedness, spatial audio better facilitated social connectedness than traditional monaural communication. Spatial audio improved feelings of being physically in the same room and being on the same wavelength and produced more nonverbal behaviors associated with rapport building than monaural communication.","Social connectedness, Spatial audio, Media naturalness theory, Interpersonal communication"
Appetite for distraction? A systematic literature review on customer smartphone distraction,"In today’s society, the ubiquitous presence of personal smartphones has led to the phenomenon of, what we call, customer smartphone distraction (CSD). This paper introduces the concept of CSD, which occurs when an internet-connected smartphone competes for a customer’s attention during a consumption goal-oriented task or behavior. Based on a three-stage research process involving a systematic literature review and an expert opinion survey with a multi-disciplinary lens to better understand this phenomenon, we develop a conceptual framework underpinned by Cognitive – Affective Personality System (CAPS) Theory that incorporates the antecedents, contingency variables, and consequences of CSD. Our findings suggest that CSD is a complex phenomenon influenced by both environmental stimuli, such as audio and visual notifications, and internal psychological states, such as boredom and anxiety, which are interdependent factors that contribute to CSD. Interestingly, the absence of environmental stimuli alone may not reduce CSD. To deal with this issue, customers need to take responsibility for their consumption behavior, while businesses, society and policy makers can assist customers through better education and design of mobile device experiences. Overall, we highlight the need for a deeper understanding of CSD and its impact on customer behavior and well-being, and outline implications to assist researchers, practitioners, policy makers and society broadly to deal with CSD.","Distraction, Smartphone, Customer wellbeing, Systematic literature review"
Verify and trust: A multidimensional survey of zero-trust security in the age of IoT,"The zero-trust (ZT) model assumes that all users, devices, and network traffic should not considered as trusted until proven. The Zero-trust model emphasizes the importance of verifying and authenticating every user and device, and limiting access to resources based on the principle of least privilege. Under the principle of the zero-trust model, devices are granted access after they have been successfully presented with their authentication credentials and access rights based on different factors, such as user identity, device health, location, and behaviour. Access controls are then continuously evaluated and updated as user properties, locations and behaviour change. The zero-trust model can be applied in various domains (healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, government etc.) to provide a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that helps organizations to reduce risk and protect critical assets. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the zero-trust model, its principles, and its applications, as well as to propose recommendations for organizations looking to adopt this approach. We explore the major components of the zero-trust framework and their integration across different practical domains. Finally, we provide insightful discussions on open research issues within the zero-trust model in terms of the security and privacy of users and devices. This paper should help researchers and practitioners understand the importance of a zero-trust framework and adopt the zero-trust model for effective security, privacy, and resilience of their networks.","Blockchain, Zero-trust architecture, Authentication and authorization, Policy-based authorization"

Improving cache-enabled D2D communications using actor–critic networks over licensed and unlicensed spectrum,"Cache-enabled Device-to-Device (D2D) communications is an effective way to improve data sharing. User Equipment (UE)-level caching holds the potential to reduce the data traffic burden on the core network. Licensed spectrum is utilized for D2D communications, but due to spectrum scarcity, exploring unlicensed spectrum is essential to enhance network capacity. In this paper, we propose caching at the UE-level and exploit both licensed and unlicensed spectrum for optimizing throughput. First, we propose a reinforcement learning-based data caching scheme leveraging an actor–critic network to improve cache-enabled D2D communications. Besides, licensed and unlicensed spectrum are devised for D2D communications considering interference from existing cellular and Wi-Fi users. A duty cycle-based unlicensed spectrum access algorithm is employed, guaranteeing the Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) required by the users. The unlicensed spectrum is prone to data packets collisions. Therefore, Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism is utilized in conjunction with Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to alleviate both the interference and packets collision problems of the unlicensed spectrum. Extensive simulations are performed to analyze the performance gain of our proposed scheme compared to the benchmarks under different network scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate that our proposed scheme possesses the potential to optimize network performance.","D2D, Unlicensed spectrum, Caching, Reinforcement learning, Actor–critic networks, Duty cycle"
A federated learning model with the whale optimization algorithm for renewable energy prediction,"Federated prediction models for energy prosumers create a global model by combining insights from local machine learning models trained on-site without centralizing the data. For time series energy data, this collaborative approach faces challenges due to the non-IID nature of the data, variations in generation patterns, the high number of model parameters, and convergence issues, leading to poor prediction accuracy. This paper introduces a novel federated learning model, FedWOA, which uses the whale optimization algorithm to determine optimal aggregation coefficients based on the local model weight vectors by pondering the updates considering the model performance and data dimensionality construct the global shared model. To handle the non-IID data the prosumers were clustered based on the similarity of their energy profiles using K-Means. FedWOA improves the prediction quality at the prosumer site, with a 16 % average reduction of the mean absolute error compared to FedAVG while demonstrating good convergence and reduced loss.","Federated learning, Whale optimization algorithm, Renewable energy prediction, Smart grid, LSTM neural network, K-Means clustering"
The Role of Trust as the Facilitator and Contingency Factor in the Adoption of Digital Healthcare Services: A Telemedicine Context,"This article revisits the effect of trust in digital healthcare services, specifically telemedicine, as a context of heightened privacy risks. It posits that trust in a telemedicine service provider causes potential users of the telemedicine service to have confidence in the service provider, and empowers them to take responsibility for their own service adoption decision. Drawing on both the unified theory of acceptance and use of the technology and the contingency theory, this article conceptualizes trust as a contingency factor (i.e., moderator) that alters the influence of the determinants of adoption decisions that have not been examined previously in the extant literature. Based on survey data from 483 consumers, the results suggest that trust in the service provider has a positive effect on the user’s intention to use a digital healthcare service (i.e., telemedicine). Moreover, it positively moderates (i.e., strengthens) the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and online privacy concerns, but negatively moderates (i.e., weakens) the effect of the facilitating conditions on this intention.","UTAUT, telemedicine, digital healthcare service, trust, online privacy concerns, technology acceptance"
A blockchain-based anonymous reporting system with no central authority: Architecture and protocol,"Blockchain technology has emerged as a compelling field of study over the past decade. Nevertheless, certain blockchain-based protocols, particularly those reliant on permissioned blockchains, continue to be under the governance of a central authority (CA). This central authority possesses extensive control capabilities, including the facilitation of user network access, as well as the establishment, connection, and revocation of users to and from the network. Consequently, the majority of policies within these protocols are centrally administered by a singular party. This paper introduces an architectural framework and a specific protocol denoted as the “Anonymous Reporting System with No Central Authority” (ARSnCA) on a public blockchain infrastructure. This design aims to mitigate the challenges posed by untrusted privileged insiders to the ARSnCA. It is hypothesized that this approach can enhance system reliability, fault tolerance, and foster trust among network members. To eliminate the central authority, a concept termed the virtual blockchain (VBC) is implemented as an embedded permissioned blockchain within a permissionless blockchain. Following the removal of the CA, the authorities previously held by the central authority are transferred to the members of the VBC. Comparative analysis and evaluation of the ARSnCA protocol demonstrate a performance advantage, with speeds that are 62% and 92% faster than reporting protocols based on ring signatures and other protocols included in the comparison.","Anonymous reporting system, Rping signature, Secret sharing, Virtual blockchain, Whistleblowing"
"Integration of traditional, transitioning & transformative digital technologies for value co-creation in B2B: A process model","The nuanced understanding of process that firms in the B2B setting undergo for VCC and the role different types of technologies play in that process is missing. We adopted a research design that comprised of four sequential phases to address this gap. In first phase, we conducted a systematic review of literature. In second phase, we deductively developed an integrated 3 × 3 framework illustrating the usage of different types of technologies across the three stages of VCC. In third phase, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 practitioners to validate the framework. Finally, in fourth phase, we developed a process model to explain how digital technology can be leveraged in each step of VCC. The process model in the backdrop of integrated framework is novel as it codifies the individual activities of VCC and brings out the nuances involved at the interaction of the activities and stages. The findings can catalyse B2B VCC at a higher speed by establishing faster feedback loops through the integration of digital technologies in each of the process steps. The gaps in research and practice on how businesses co-creating value can iterate to get a testable product with a measurable outcome while leveraging digital technologies are discussed.","B2B, Value co-creation, Digital technology, Technology adoption, Integrated framework, Process model"
