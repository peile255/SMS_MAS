These IoTDs support real-time applications like multimedia and Metaverse services, which demand high computational resources and strict quality of service (QoS) guarantees, specifically in terms of latency and efficient task queue management. However, IoTDs often face constraints in energy and computational power, requiring efficient queue management and task scheduling to maintain QoS. To address these challenges, UAVs and HAPS are deployed to supplement the computational limitations of IoTDs by offloading tasks for distributed processing. Due to UAVs' resource limitations, particularly in terms of power and coverage area, HAPS are used to enhance their capabilities and extend coverage. Overloaded UAVs may relay tasks to HAPS, creating a multi-tier computing system. This paper addresses the overall energy minimization problem in the MEC-enabled air-ground integrated network (MAGIN) by optimizing UAV trajectories, computing resource allocation, and queue-aware task offloading decisions. The optimization problem is highly complex due to the nonconvex and nonlinear nature of this hierarchical system, which traditional methods cannot effectively solve. To tackle this, we reformulate the problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) with continuous action spaces and heterogeneous agents. We propose a novel variant of multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with Beta distribution (MAPPO-BD) to solve this problem. Extensive simulations show that MAPPO-BD significantly outperforms other baselines, achieving superior energy savings and efficient resource management in MAGIN, while adhering to constraints related to queue delays and edge computing capabilities.  © 2025 IEEE.","air-ground network; edge network; Metaverse; Mobile edge computing; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001386163"

However, the rapid evolution of the Metaverse presents challenges that surpass the capabilities of existing communication and network infrastructures, particularly on network bandwidth and latency. Additionally, human experience becomes a critical factor in this domain. Therefore, we introduce a human-aware hierarchical software defined network (SDN) architecture consisting of a Metaverse cloud layer, a mobile edge computing (MEC) server empowered edge layer, and a distributed terminal layer. Each MEC server dynamically controls a multi-antenna base station (BS) and several reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) according to the terminal immersive experience requirements in real-time. To overcome the bandwidth limitation, we propose a novel smart reconfigurable spatial reuse new radio in unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) framework, which can realize customizable communications through flexibly and coordinately reconfiguring beams among the coordination between BSs and RISs. The objective function is formulated as a Lyapunov optimization based decentralized partially-observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) problem to maximize the spectral efficiency while guaranteeing the latency and reliability requirements in Metaverse, via a joint user selection, phase-shift control, and beam coordination strategy. To solve the above non-convex, strongly coupled, and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose a novel multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (MAHDRL) algorithm that integrates deep Q-network (DQN) to solve discrete problems, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to solve continuous problems, and mixing network to capture complex interactions between multiple agents. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and verify the performance improvements compared to traditional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","distributed coordination; dynamic network control; Human-aware; metaverse; multi-agent; NR-U; RIS","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184814384"

Based on this, a novel quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning (QMARL)-based scheduler, prioritizing the improvement of the performance of meta-space rendering is proposed in this article. The increase in performance can be achieved by controlling the number of utilized point cloud segments depending on avatar-popularity under the consideration of physical-space constraints. During this process, QMARL-centered quantum artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are utilized for sequential scheduling action decision-making over time. By utilizing this QMARL, our proposed scheduler is designed to reduce the number of scheduling action dimensions into logarithmic scales. This is beneficial in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era as the number of usable qubits is inherently limited. After this QMARL-based scheduling, the scheduled regions will be re-constructed over meta-space with prioritized point cloud registration. Finally, our performance evaluation results show that our proposed scheduler outperforms classical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based scheduling in terms of utility between 12.6 and 20.7 percent, under various avatar distributions.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207155533"

In metaverse, digital entities coexist with their physical counterparts. Powered by deep learning, metaverse is inevitably becoming more intelligent in the interactions between reality and virtuality. However, it is confronted with a nontrivial problem known as sim2real transfer when deep learning techniques try to bridge the reality gap between the physical world and simulations. In this article, we use multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) to implement collective intelligence for digital entities as well as their physical counterparts. To model the immersive environments in metaverse, we define a nonstationary variant of Markov games and propose a recurrent MARL solution to it. Based on the solution, MARL sim2real transfer that bridges real and virtual multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems is successfully conducted by employing recurrent multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (R-MADDPG) with the domain randomization technique. Additionally, we use perception-control modularization to improve the generalization performance of MARL policies and make training more efficient.  © 2013 IEEE.","Metaverse; multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL); multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) nonstationary Markov game; sim2real transfer","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146223475"

To address these issues, we propose adaptive social metaverse streaming (ASMS), a novel streaming system based on federated multiagent proximal policy optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remain on local devices.  © 2014 IEEE.","Adaptive bit rate (ABR) streaming; extended reality (XR); federated learning (FL); multiagent reinforcement learning; social metaverse","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002559480"

As interactions in social virtual reality take place through avatars, the behaviour, and in particular the eye gaze of an avatar can have an impact on the user experience. However, it is still unclear which features of the user experience are most influenced. Therefore, this study used data from 44 female participants to investigate how avatar gaze behaviour (static eyes vs. real-time tracked eyes) affects their perceived quality of communication and the amount of one-sided eye contact participants make during a communicative or collaborative task in virtual reality. In addition, the study investigated the mediating role of perceived avatar “uncanniness” (i.e., the finding that humanoid objects that imperfectly resemble real people evoke feelings of discomfort) in this relationship and the moderation effect of two multi-user scenarios (collaboration vs. communication). The results showed that uncanniness directly affected the perceived quality of communication. However, it did not significantly mediate the relationship between avatar eye gaze behaviour and the quality of communication or the amount of one-sided eye contact. Finally, there were no significant differences in user experience between the two scenarios. From this, we can conclude that the uncanniness of an avatar being interacted with in VR is not enough to hinder communication and collaboration in an immersive medium. And even if an avatar is perceived as uncanny, normative communication cues such as eye contact are still present. Notably, due to sample availability, the results of this study are based on a female-only sample. Thus, future research can benefit from exploring the outlined effects in a more gender-balanced sample. © 2023 The Author(s)","Avatar uncanniness; Collaboration; Communication; Eye tracking; Moderated mediation analysis; Multi-agent; Virtual reality","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174395861"

To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduler for minimizing the maximum network E2E latency. The RL model used the double deep Q-network (DDQN) with the prioritized experience replay (PER). In order to see the performance change according to the type of RL agent, we implemented a single-agent environment where the controller is an agent and a multi-agent environment where each node is an agent. Since the agents were unable to identify E2E latencies in the multi-agent environment, the state and reward were formulated using the estimated E2E latencies. To precisely evaluate the RL-based scheduler, we set out benchmark algorithms to compare with which a network-arrival-time-based heuristic algorithm (NAT-HA) and a maximum-estimated-delay-based heuristic algorithm (MED-HA). The RL-based scheduler, first-in-first-out (FIFO), round-robin (RR), NAT-HA, and MED-HA were compared through large-scale simulations on four network topologies. The simulation results in fixed-packet generation scenarios showed that our proposal, the RL-based scheduler, achieved the minimization of maximum E2E latency in all the topologies. In other scenarios with random flow generation, the RL-based scheduler and MED-HA showed the lowest maximum E2E latency for all topologies. Depending on the topology, the maximum E2E latency of NAT-HA was equal to or larger than that of the RL-based scheduler. In terms of fairness, the RL-based scheduler showed a higher level of fairness than that of FIFO and RR. NAT-HA had similar or lower fairness than the RL-based scheduler depending on the topology, and MED-HA had the same level of fairness as the RL-based scheduler. © 2023 by the authors.","double-deep Q-learning; end-to-end latency; fairness; min-max criterion; prioritized experience replay; reinforcement learning","MDPI","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151555628"

The immersive experience is achieved through seamless human-avatar interaction, e.g., augmented reality navigation, which requires intensive resources that are inefficient and impractical to process on intelligent vehicles locally. Fortunately, offloading avatar tasks to roadside units (RSUs) or cloud servers for remote execution can effectively reduce resource consumption. However, the high mobility of vehicles, the dynamic workload of RSUs, and the heterogeneity of RSUs pose novel challenges to making avatar migration decisions. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a dynamic migration framework for avatar tasks based on real-time trajectory prediction and multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Specifically, we propose a model to predict the future trajectories of intelligent vehicles based on their historical data, indicating the future workloads of RSUs. Based on the expected workloads of RSUs, we formulate the avatar task migration problem as a long-term mixed-integer programming problem. To tackle this problem efficiently, the problem is transformed into a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and solved by multiple DRL agents with hybrid continuous and discrete actions in decentralized. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the latency of executing avatar tasks by around 25% without prediction and 30% with prediction and enhance user immersive experiences in the AIoT-enabled Vehicular Metaverse (AeVeM).  © 2023 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT); avatar; Metaverses; multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL); service migration; trajectory prediction","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165285021"

For this purpose, this paper proposes a novel system-wide coordination algorithm for high synchronization under characteristics (i.e., highly realistic meta-space construction under the constraints of physical-space). The proposed algorithm consists of the following three stages. The first stage is quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning (QMARL)-based scheduling for low-delay temporal-synchronization using differentiated age-of-information (AoI) during data gathering in physical-space by observers for meta-space construction. This is beneficial for scalability according to action dimension reduction in reinforcement learning computation. The second stage is for creating virtual contents under delay constraints in meta-space based on the gathered data. When rendering regions that have received more user attention, avatar-popularity is considered for spatio-synchronization. Thus, a stabilized control mechanism is designed for time-average reality quality maximization for each region.

However, the metaverse applications will generate diversified communication services with differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, which will be a great challenge for F6G to develop End-to-End (E2E) customized transmission strategies. Traditional single metric-based routing algorithms cannot efficiently orchestrate the network resources to meet the diversified QoS requirements. To solve the above problems, we propose a Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Co-MARL) routing algorithm, which measures the differentiated QoS demands through a generic utility function to facilitate multiple agents to solve the multi-objective optimization problem.

In AR assisted driving, physical environment scenes are first captured by Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and are uploaded to the Metaverse. A central Metaverse Map Service Provider (MMSP) will aggregate information from all IoVs to develop a central Metaverse Map. Information from the Metaverse Map can then be downloaded into individual IoVs on demand and be delivered as AR scenes to the driver. However, the growing interest in developing AR assisted driving applications which relies on digital twinning invites adversaries. These adversaries may place physical adversarial patches on physical world objects such as cars, signboards, or on roads, seeking to contort the virtual world digital twin. Hence, there is a need to detect these physical world adversarial patches. Nevertheless, as real-time, accurate detection of adversarial patches is compute-intensive, these physical world scenes have to be offloaded to the Metaverse Map Base Stations (MMBS) for computation. Hence in our work, we considered an environment with moving Internet of Vehicles (IoV), uploading real-time physical world scenes to the MMBSs. We formulated a realistic joint variable optimization problem where the MMSPs' objective is to maximize adversarial patch detection mean average precision (mAP), while minimizing the computed AR scene up-link transmission latency and IoVs' up-link transmission idle count, through optimizing the IoV-MMBS allocation and IoV up-link scene resolution selection. We proposed a Heterogeneous Action Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) (discrete-continuous) algorithm to tackle the proposed problem.

As a result, implementing a hybrid quantum-classical system is regarded as one of effective strategies. In hybrid quantum-classical systems, quantum computing devices can be used for computation-intensive applications, such as massive scheduling in dynamic environments. Furthermore, one of most popular network applications is advanced social media services such as metaverse. Accordingly, this paper proposes an advanced multi-metaverse dynamic streaming algorithm in hybrid quantum-classical systems. For this purpose, the proposed algorithm consists of three stages. For the first stage, three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data gathering should be conducted using spatially scheduled observing devices from physical-spaces for constructing virtual multiple meta-spaces in metaverse server. This is for massive scheduling over dynamic situations, i.e., quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning-based scheduling is utilized for scheduling dimension reduction into a logarithmic-scale. For the second stage, a temporal low-delay metaverse server's processor scheduler is designed for region-popularity-aware multiple virtual meta-spaces rendering contents allocation via modified bin-packing with hard real-time constraints. Lastly, a novel dynamic dynamic streaming algorithm is proposed for high-quality, differentiated, and stabilized meta-spaces rendering contents delivery to individual users via Lyapunov optimization theory. Our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed spatio-temporal algorithm outperforms benchmarks in various aspects over hybrid quantum-classical systems.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.","dynamic streaming; Hybrid quantum-classical systems; metaverse; quantum deep learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213481965"

However, rendering these virtual environments is resource-intensive. With many users accessing simultaneously and requiring diverse Metaverse services, optimizing Metaverse resources to deliver the best quality-of-experience (QoE) for users is a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a cooperative virtual reality (VR) rendering and dynamic resource leasing mechanism to address this issue. Specifically, we first introduce a cooperative VR scene pre-rendering framework between users and Planets (i.e., edge servers hosting users), and establish a new user QoE metric named EdgeVRQoE which considers both rendering delay and visual quality. We formulate the multidimensional rendering resources (e.g., GPU, CPU, and outbound bandwidth) leasing problem between Planets and users as a double-layer decision problem, and devise a hybrid action multi-agent reinforcement learning-based dynamic resource auction mechanism to efficiently allocate limited resources of Planets in a distributed and adaptive manner. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the representatives in user QoE and resource utilization efficiency. Particularly, the proposed scheme shows at least an 18-fold improvement in QoE over other schemes, demonstrating its capability in providing immersive Metaverse experiences. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","cooperative VR rendering; dynamic resource leasing; MARL; Metaverse; QoE","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005181870"

Tailor-made mechanisms are engaging in the light of disputes to resolve emerging contradictions between the atoms. Most of the dominant blockchain architectures tend to oversee this fact. They come integrated with rigid, overkilling consensus-achievement procedures, which, in many cases, are not necessary or significantly beneficial. They often raise overwhelming demands on the nodes and prohibit the deployment of fully distributed and peer blockchain operation in the IoT world. Still, for the IoT ecosystems and the metaverse to become self-sustainable and self-evolving, robust validity mechanisms must be embedded in the atomic scale. This work investigates the process of building and sustaining scalable consensus policies over the trivial atomic capacities of the IoT ecosystems. For this, we deploy the IoT microblockchain framework as an atomic consistency tier and we define a primary set of validity rules that every node can easily carry out. The initial concept relies on Gödel's incompleteness theorems and K. Friston's free energy principle and is investigated under the perspectives of graph and game theory. To study the dynamic behavior of the system, a competitive game among the nodes is run. The Proof of Existence (PoE) is utilized as a universal proofing case. Its feasibility is demonstrated, and its complexity is analyzed under various system considerations. The findings prove that finite-capacity atoms can collectively and efficiently support verifiable validity and scalable consensus in the evolutionary IoT ecosystems and the metaverse, even under conditions of high diversity, trivial capacity, and eventual consistency.  © 2014 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI)-intensive multiagent systems; evolutionary systems; IoT microblockchain; IoT sustainable transactional trust; peer IoT ecosystems; rational metaverse; reality modeling; scalable consensus; validity in IoT ecosystems","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142269441"

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation.

In vehicular Metaverse applications, avatars are digital representations of on-board users to obtain and manage immersive vehicular services (i.e., avatar tasks) in Metaverses and the data they generate. However, traditional Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data management solutions have serious data security risks and privacy protection. Fortunately, blockchain-based Web 3.0 enables avatars to have an ownership identity to securely manage the data owned by users in a decentralized and transparent manner. To ensure users' immersive experiences and securely manage their data, avatar tasks often require significant computing resources. Therefore, it is impractical for the vehicles to process avatar tasks locally, massive computation resources are needed to support the avatar tasks. To this end, offloading avatar tasks to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs) is a promising solution to avoid computation overload. To ensure real-time and continuous Metaverse services, the avatar tasks should be migrated among the RSUs when the vehicle navigation. It is challenging for the vehicles to independently decide whether migrate or not according to current and future avatar states. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new avatar task migration framework for vehicular Metaverses. We then formulate the avatar task migration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and apply a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) algorithm to dynamically make migration decisions for avatar tasks. Numerous results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines for avatar task migration and enables immersive vehicular Metaverse services.  © 2023 ACM.","avatar migration; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; vehicular Metaverse","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159618120"

However, one of the key challenges in realizing the full potential of 6G lies in efficiently managing and trading resources across diverse domains in terrestrial and non-terrestrial integrated networks (TN-NTN). In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-domain resource trading approach that integrates blockchain technology, hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (HMADRL), and multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg games to address this challenge. HMADRL provides an intelligent and adaptable framework for resource requesters and provider agents to learn optimal resource allocation methods in multiple domains. The MLMF Stackelberg game framework represents the strategic interactions between virtual service providers (SPs), network operators, and computing resource providers to enable them to make dynamic resource allocation and pricing decisions. This hierarchical decision-making strategy ensures a structured bargaining mechanism where leaders optimize their revenue by setting resource pricing and followers strategically decide on their resource-buying strategies.

Users engaging with vehicular metaverses (VMUs) gain entry by consistently updating their vehicular twins (VTs), which are deployed on roadside units (RSUs) in proximity. The constrained RSU coverage and the consistently moving vehicles necessitate the continuous migration of VTs between RSUs through vehicle road cooperation, ensuring uninterrupted immersion services for VMUs. Nevertheless, the VT migration process faces challenges in obtaining adequate bandwidth resources from RSUs for timely migration, posing a resource trading problem among RSUs. In this article, we tackle this challenge by formulating a game-theoretic incentive mechanism with multileader multifollower, incorporating insights from social-awareness and queueing theory to optimize VT migration. To validate the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), we apply the backward induction method. Theoretical solutions for this equilibrium are then obtained through the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) algorithm. Moreover, owing to incomplete information caused by the requirements for privacy protection, we proposed a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm named multiagent long short-term memory-based proximal policy optimization (MALPPO). MALPPO facilitates learning the SE without requiring private information from others, relying solely on past experiences. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our MALPPO-based incentive mechanism outperforms baseline approaches significantly, showcasing rapid convergence and achieving the highest reward. © 2014 IEEE.","Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM); deep reinforcement learning (DRL); metaverse; multileader multifollower Stackelberg game; vehicle road cooperation","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190801114"

Due to the limited bandwidth, we propose to use semantic extraction algorithms to reduce the delivered data by the sensing IoT devices. Nevertheless, mechanisms to hire sensing IoT devices to share their data with the VSP and then deliver the constructed digital twin to the Metaverse users are vulnerable to adverse selection problem. The adverse selection problem, which is caused by information asymmetry between the system entities, becomes harder to solve when the private information of the different entities are multi-dimensional. We propose a novel iterative contract design and use a new variant of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve the modelled multi-dimensional contract problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct extensive simulations and measure several key performance metrics of the contract for the Metaverse. Our results show that our designed iterative contract is able to incentivize the participants to interact truthfully, which maximizes the profit of the VSP with minimal individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) violation rates. Furthermore, the proposed learning-based iterative contract framework has limited access to the private information of the participants, which is to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind in addressing the problem of adverse selection in incentive mechanisms.  © 2023 IEEE.","age of information; contract theory; deep reinforcement learning; Digital twin; semantic communication","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182379804"

The system processes binocular video streams and IMU data to deploy advanced deep learning techniques, including instance segmentation and dense optical flow prediction, facilitated by a specially curated target dataset. The integration of a ResNet101+FPN backbone for model training results in a combat unit type recognition accuracy of 91.8%, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.808, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.606. A dynamic scene localization and perception module utilizes these deep learning outputs to refine pose estimations and enhance localization accuracy by overcoming environmental complexities and motion-induced errors, typically associated with SLAM methodologies. Application tests conducted within a simulated battlefield metaverse environment demonstrate a 44.2% improvement in self-localization accuracy over traditional ORB-SLAM2 Stereo methods. The system efficiently tracks and annotates dynamic and static battlefield ele-ments, continuously updating global maps with precise data on agent poses and target move-ments. This work not only addresses the dynamic complexity and potential information loss in battlefield scenarios but also lays a foundational framework for future enhancements in network capabilities and environment reconstruction methodologies. Future developments will focus on precise identification of combat unit models, multi-agent collaboration, and the application of 3D scene perception to advance real-time decision-making and tactical planning in joint combat scenarios.

UAV twins (UTs), as the digital twins of UAVs that revolutionize UAV applications by making them more immersive, realistic, and informative, are deployed and updated on ground base stations, e.g., roadside units (RSUs), to offer metaverse services for UAV metaverse users (UMUs). Due to the dynamic mobility of UAVs and limited communication coverages of RSUs, it is essential to perform real-time UT migration to ensure seamless immersive experiences for UMUs.

To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces.

However, the heterogeneous caching hardware, communication environments, and frequent network dynamics make the optimization of content caching policy highly complicated. Firstly, considering all LEO satellites as caching satellites can lead to content duplication and radio interference, causing storage waste and NTN transmission quality deterioration. Secondly, how to provide customized QoS by intra-layer and inter-layer cooperative caching in such complicated environments remains an open issue. Thus, we propose a Delay-Motivated Ant Colony Optimization (DM-ACO) scheme to select caching LEO satellites with reduced system propagation delay. Then, the Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Hierarchical Caching and Asynchronous Updating (MADRL-HCAU) strategy is designed to manage the caching capacity of LEO satellites and UAVs, providing customized services for CAVs and dispensing the peak traffic.

A key issue that emerges in such environments is how one entity can trust another. Here, the concept of trust is considered as a meta-requirement, that is, the level of belief a service requestor has that a service provider will provide the service in a way that meets the requestor's expectations. We refer to the service offering entities as service providers (SPs) and the service requesting entities as service clients (SCs). In this paper, we propose a technique that allows for evaluating trust and assigning reputation to various service providers by considering first their ability to fulfill their clients' expectations or policies, and second the reputation other service clients have, when acting as recommenders for the aforementioned service providers. In this work, service clients and service providers are considered as virtual entities that coordinate with each other, and may include physical users, avatars, micro-services, software agents, smart contracts or any other distributed inter-networked resource, without making any assumptions as to what a service client or a service provider entity is as long as it participates in an interaction. © 2023 IEEE.","Distributed Components; Metaverse; Multi-agent Systems; Reputation Systems; Service-oriented Computing; Trust","IEEE Computer Society","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168859486"

This problem aims to minimize energy consumption while maximizing Meta-Immersion (MI), a metric that integrates objective network performance with subjective user perception. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with User-Object-Attention (M2ERL-UOA) algorithm. The algorithm employs a prediction-driven evolutionary learning mechanism for multi-agents, coupled with optimized rendering capacity decisions for virtual objects. The algorithm can yield a superior Pareto front that attains the Nash equilibrium.

In this paper, we provide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for finding the link metrics that allow link-state multicast routing protocols to achieve optimal traffic engineering. To meet the real-time requirement, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) solution to the problem of link weights adjustment to achieve efficient multicast routing in a distributed fashion. In our design, the agents collaborate and communicate with the others in the local region and learn from their experiences to determine the best action to minimize the overall network cost.

This unprecedented metaverse-infused driving experience, however, requires high-throughput transmissions for real-time high-quality 360° video streaming, which challenges today's limited bandwidth resources provisioned by wireless communication infrastructure. To this end, this article introduces virtual road, real connection (VRRC), a novel framework for enhancing the metaverse-infused driving experience in VANET through the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). In the face of limited bandwidth resources, VRRC effectively addresses the challenge of high-throughput demand from two key perspectives. First, VRRC reduces redundant transmission by implementing a graph neural network (GNN)-based vehicle clustering method for dynamic multicast group formation, taking into account both the geographical status of vehicles and their communication patterns. Second, VRRC aggregates bandwidth resources across various channels by employing a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based multipath packet scheduling policy to adapt to heterogeneous channel conditions and dynamic vehicular mobility. Extensive experiments with real-world vehicular traces validate the effectiveness of VRRC and demonstrate its outperformance in reducing redundant traffic by 54% and improving overall throughput by 28%.

However, with the rapid development of technologies, such as the Internet of Things and multimodal large language models, traditional tourism is unable to meet the demand for intelligent and personalized travel experiences. To address this, this paper proposes an interactive personalized tourism service system based on the concept of parallel intelligence, utilizing the ACP approach and multimodal large language models. The system constructs a comprehensive tourism model and leverages retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent collaboration systems to create a new paradigm for personalized tourism services. Additionally, this paper explores the application ecosystem of parallel tourism, expanding the tourism ecosystem from four aspects: clothing, food, accommodation and transportation. This paper analyzes the integration of other industries with personalized tourism services. Parallel tourism is poised to bring new possibilities for the development of the tourism service industry. © 2024 Beijing Xintong Media Co., Ltd..

At the same time, it raises new technical challenges due to its unique characteristics. On the one hand, metaverse applications are composed of multiple computing sub-tasks, and performing these sub-tasks sequentially can hinder computational efficiency. On the other hand, current centralized task offloading for metaverse applications is contrary to the core concept of Web 3.0. Moreover, fair incentives for all participants are not fully considered. To address these issues, a new computing paradigm for metaverse is required. Hence, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Intelligent Dispersed Computing Framework (BIDC). In this paper, we first design a two-layered architecture and model the sub-tasks as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) by utilizing their dependent relations. Inspired by the interconnection of blocks in blockchain, BIDC transforms the execution process of sub-tasks into a mining process, cleverly integrating task computation with mining. On this basis, Mining Mechanism and Main Chain Confirmation Mechanisms are presented, to ensure the efficiency of task offloading and the fairness of reward distribution. Then BIDC transforms the overhead time minimization problem into a multi-party mining problem. By leveraging Actor-Critic-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, every device can dynamically adjust its own mining strategy to achieve the lowest latency. At last, experimental results demonstrate BIDC's reliability, scalability, and superior service quality compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Deep reinforcement learning; Edge computing; Task offloading","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006878090"

To enable the virtual world to better reflect the physical world, a great deal of sensed information in types of text, pictures, voice, and videos should be fetched by metaverse applications. Edge caching has been considered to improve transmission quality and data protection by storing the needed contents near users rather than in the cloud. However, qualified edge caching for the metaverse of CAVs (meta-CAVs) and metaverse of ITSs (meta-ITSs) is challenged by ubiquitous mobilities, diversified requirements, dynamic content popularity, and heterogeneous infrastructure. In this article, we elaborate on the requirements and challenges of edge caching for meta-CAVs and meta-ITSs. We then discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in edge caching to improve the performance and security of meta-CAVs and meta-ITSs. To evaluate our idea, a case study with the Multi-Agent Federated Reinforcement Learning (MAFRL)-based intelligent edge caching is provided.

However, the ultra-density of LEO satellites complicates the selection of caching nodes, while the heteroge-neous caching hardware and communication environments make optimization of content deployment highly difficult. To address these issues, we propose an intelligent hierarchical caching and asynchronous updating scheme. Specifically, a Delay-Motivated Ant Colony Optimization (DM-ACO) scheme is first adopted to select the caching LEO satellites to reduce the system propagation delay. Then, the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Hi-erarchical Caching and Asynchronous Updating (MARL-HCAU) strategy is proposed to meet caching service demands. Simulation results illustrate that compared with the benchmarks, the overall cache hit ratio increases by 14.2 % with the reduced packet drop rate and transmission delay by 8.78 % and 0.94s, respectively.  © 2024 IEEE.","ant colony optimization; hierarchical caching; Non-Terrestrial Networks; reinforcement learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198845414"

Towards enabling this wireless metaverse, in this article we propose a novel semantic communication (SC) framework by decomposing the metaverse into human/machine agent-specific semantic multiverses (SMs). An SM stored at each agent comprises a semantic encoder and a generator, leveraging recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI). To improve communication efficiency, the encoder learns the semantic representations (SRs) of multi-modal data, while the generator learns how to manipulate them for locally rendering scenes and interactions in the metaverse. Since these learned SMs are biased towards local environments, their success hinges on synchronizing heterogeneous SMs in the background while communicating SRs in the foreground, turning the wireless metaverse problem into the problem of semantic multiverse communication (SMC). Based on this SMC architecture, we propose several promising algorithmic and analytic tools for modeling and designing SMC, ranging from distributed learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to signaling games and symbolic AI. © 2023 IEEE.","extended reality (XR); federated learning; Metaverse; multi-agent reinforcement learning; semantic communication; signaling game; split learning; symbolic artificial intelligence","IEEE Computer Society","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177465286"
