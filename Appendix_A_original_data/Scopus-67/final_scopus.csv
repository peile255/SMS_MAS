Metaversal intelligence: Unifying human-AI interactions in human-in-the-loop AIB-Metaverse,"The convergence of 6G and Web 3 technologies with the Metaverse necessitates user-centric, intelligent solutions to address challenges of adaptability, scalability, and efficiency in decentralized systems. This paper introduces the Human-AI Blockchain (HAIB) Metaverse architecture and the Intelligent Smart Contract (InSC) framework, which integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) and extended stigmergy to optimize multi-agent interactions and enable dynamic, self-executing smart contracts. The HAIB architecture enhances human-AI collaboration through a human-in-the-loop approach, facilitating adaptive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Serving as the cognitive core, the InSC framework combines dynamic environmental feedback with real-time data analytics to enable intelligent decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces gas consumption by 32–33% while increasing cumulative rewards. These findings highlight the significant potential of intelligent smart contracts in advancing decentralized intelligence within the Metaverse. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Blockchain; Extended stigmergy; HAIB-Metaverse architecture; Intelligent smart contract; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Web 3
Multi-Agent DRL for Queue-Aware Task Offloading in Hierarchical MEC-Enabled Air-Ground Networks,"Mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled air-ground networks advance 6G wireless networks by utilizing aerial base stations (ABSs) such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high altitude platform stations (HAPS) to provide dynamic services to ground IoT devices (IoTDs). These IoTDs support real-time applications like multimedia and Metaverse services, which demand high computational resources and strict quality of service (QoS) guarantees, specifically in terms of latency and efficient task queue management. However, IoTDs often face constraints in energy and computational power, requiring efficient queue management and task scheduling to maintain QoS. To address these challenges, UAVs and HAPS are deployed to supplement the computational limitations of IoTDs by offloading tasks for distributed processing. Due to UAVs' resource limitations, particularly in terms of power and coverage area, HAPS are used to enhance their capabilities and extend coverage. Overloaded UAVs may relay tasks to HAPS, creating a multi-tier computing system. This paper addresses the overall energy minimization problem in the MEC-enabled air-ground integrated network (MAGIN) by optimizing UAV trajectories, computing resource allocation, and queue-aware task offloading decisions. The optimization problem is highly complex due to the nonconvex and nonlinear nature of this hierarchical system, which traditional methods cannot effectively solve. To tackle this, we reformulate the problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) with continuous action spaces and heterogeneous agents. We propose a novel variant of multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with Beta distribution (MAPPO-BD) to solve this problem. Extensive simulations show that MAPPO-BD significantly outperforms other baselines, achieving superior energy savings and efficient resource management in MAGIN, while adhering to constraints related to queue delays and edge computing capabilities.  © 2025 IEEE.",air-ground network; edge network; Metaverse; Mobile edge computing; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
Human-Aware Dynamic Hierarchical Network Control for Distributed Metaverse Services,"Metaverse has emerged as a revolutionary technique for transforming the way people interact with digital content, which relies on a distributed computing and communication infrastructure, encompassing terminal users, edge servers, and cloud servers. However, the rapid evolution of the Metaverse presents challenges that surpass the capabilities of existing communication and network infrastructures, particularly on network bandwidth and latency. Additionally, human experience becomes a critical factor in this domain. Therefore, we introduce a human-aware hierarchical software defined network (SDN) architecture consisting of a Metaverse cloud layer, a mobile edge computing (MEC) server empowered edge layer, and a distributed terminal layer. Each MEC server dynamically controls a multi-antenna base station (BS) and several reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) according to the terminal immersive experience requirements in real-time. To overcome the bandwidth limitation, we propose a novel smart reconfigurable spatial reuse new radio in unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) framework, which can realize customizable communications through flexibly and coordinately reconfiguring beams among the coordination between BSs and RISs. The objective function is formulated as a Lyapunov optimization based decentralized partially-observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) problem to maximize the spectral efficiency while guaranteeing the latency and reliability requirements in Metaverse, via a joint user selection, phase-shift control, and beam coordination strategy. To solve the above non-convex, strongly coupled, and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose a novel multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (MAHDRL) algorithm that integrates deep Q-network (DQN) to solve discrete problems, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to solve continuous problems, and mixing network to capture complex interactions between multiple agents. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and verify the performance improvements compared to traditional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.",distributed coordination; dynamic network control; Human-aware; metaverse; multi-agent; NR-U; RIS
The Matrix: Quantum AI for Interacting Two Worlds in Prioritized Metaverse Spaces,"In modern network applications, the concept of metaverse is an emerging technology, and one of its key characteristics is the separation between the physical-space of the users and the virtual meta-space of the avatars. Based on this, a novel quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning (QMARL)-based scheduler, prioritizing the improvement of the performance of meta-space rendering is proposed in this article. The increase in performance can be achieved by controlling the number of utilized point cloud segments depending on avatar-popularity under the consideration of physical-space constraints. During this process, QMARL-centered quantum artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are utilized for sequential scheduling action decision-making over time. By utilizing this QMARL, our proposed scheduler is designed to reduce the number of scheduling action dimensions into logarithmic scales. This is beneficial in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era as the number of usable qubits is inherently limited. After this QMARL-based scheduling, the scheduled regions will be re-constructed over meta-space with prioritized point cloud registration. Finally, our performance evaluation results show that our proposed scheduler outperforms classical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based scheduling in terms of utility between 12.6 and 20.7 percent, under various avatar distributions.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.",
Metaverse Community Group Loyalty Contagion and Regulation Model Based on User Stickiness,"The investigation into the micro-social behaviours of groups in metaverse communities is minimal. This paper proposes a user stickiness-based loyalty contagion and regulation model in a meta-verse community inspired by user stickiness in the real world. We hope to establish a link between user stickiness and group loyalty through community regulation, enhance user stickiness, and improve metaverse community loyalty. We verified the feasibility and robust-ness of the model through simulation experiments and obtained the optimal community regulation intensity through sensitivity analy-sis experiments. Our results show that communities can maintain healthy long-term development when optimal community regulation intensity is adopted.  © 2023 IEEE.",Group simulation; Loyalty; Metaverse ecosystem; Multi-Agents; Social behaviour modelling; User stickiness
Metaverse: A Solution to the Multi-Agent Value Alignment Problem,"AI Safety researchers attempting to align values of highly capable intelligent systems with those of humanity face a number of challenges including personal value extraction, multi-agent value merger and finally in-silico encoding. State-of-the-art research in value alignment shows difficulties in every stage in this process, but merger of incompatible preferences is a particularly difficult challenge to overcome. In this paper, we assume that the value extraction problem will be solved and propose a possible way to implement an AI solution which optimally aligns with individual preferences of each user. We conclude by analyzing benefits and limitations of the proposed approach. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",AI safety; alternate reality; simulation; value alignment problem; VR

MARL Sim2real Transfer: Merging Physical Reality With Digital Virtuality in Metaverse,"Metaverse is an artificial virtual world mapped from and interacting with the real world. In metaverse, digital entities coexist with their physical counterparts. Powered by deep learning, metaverse is inevitably becoming more intelligent in the interactions between reality and virtuality. However, it is confronted with a nontrivial problem known as sim2real transfer when deep learning techniques try to bridge the reality gap between the physical world and simulations. In this article, we use multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) to implement collective intelligence for digital entities as well as their physical counterparts. To model the immersive environments in metaverse, we define a nonstationary variant of Markov games and propose a recurrent MARL solution to it. Based on the solution, MARL sim2real transfer that bridges real and virtual multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems is successfully conducted by employing recurrent multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (R-MADDPG) with the domain randomization technique. Additionally, we use perception-control modularization to improve the generalization performance of MARL policies and make training more efficient.  © 2013 IEEE.",Metaverse; multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL); multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) nonstationary Markov game; sim2real transfer
Resource Allocation and QoE Maximization in Aerial MEC-empowered Metaverse Service: A CCM-Multi-agent DRL approach,"The integration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) with aerial platforms introduces novel potential for the Metaverse world by providing low-latency and highly reliable computing and communication services at the network edge. Nevertheless, this integration presents critical challenges, such as low Quality of Experience (QoE) due to the dynamic nature of aerial platforms, high resource demands, and the requirements for real-time data processing in the Metaverse environment. To address these challenges, we propose a Combinatorial Client-Master Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (CCM-MADRL) based joint resource allocation and QoE maximization framework to enable intelligent real-time decision-making in aerial MEC enabled Metaverse services. We form a collaborative ecosystem where agents are designed to represent both Metaverse service providers and aerial platforms to promote fairness and efficiency in resource allocation, as well as optimize service delivery. By incorporating CCM, our approach considers diverse metrics, such as latency, reliability, meta-distance, and energy efficiency, to ensure a holistic optimization of Metaverse services. The MADRL approach enables adaptive decision-making, allowing the system to respond to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of Metaverse applications. Results from simulations that mimic realistic Metaverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CCM-MADRL framework in terms of improved service performance, reduced latency, cost, and virtual meta-distance, maximized average QoE utility of Metaverse users, and enhanced resource utilization compared to baseline algorithms. © 2024 IEEE.",CCM-MADRL; meta-distance; Metaverse; Quality of experience; Resource allocation

On the other hand, it is difficult to understanding what information is got in computers for user. We are in the network-age since 1995. We use PC, smart phone, iPad and other digital gadget which are connected to the Internet every time anywhere. For keeping safety, there are many monitoring video cameras in public and private space. Of course, the privacy policy is kept ones privacy. On the other hand, we are in defragmented by the Network. We use many communication tools to contact business person, family, friend and another person. Theses communication tools are e-mail, twitter, blog, messenger, SNS and another communication tools in the Internet. We can not feel the person's awareness in real time with such kind of digital communication tools. This kind of communication gap makes loneliness of home worker. In this paper, we show the concept of the sharing users' awareness between fragmented people on the Internet and show how to get user awareness from multiple sensor devices. © 2010 IEEE.",Awareness; Cyber space; Metaverse; Symbiotic computing; Ubiquitous system. multi-agent system; Virtual realty

On a Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Objective Routing Strategy for Diversified 6G Metaverse Services,"Metaverse has been widely recognized as an important 6G application with increasingly stringent, detailed, and diversified requirements for multiple Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. However, traditional routing strategies are usually based on unified weights and select the paths independently, which neglects the service diversity and resource constraints. In this paper, we focus on the diversified metaverse service requirements and propose the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based multiple objective routing strategy for different services. Multiple agents in the DRL model cooperatively select the paths to improve the resource utilization efficiency. Simulation results illustrate that our proposal outperforms traditional strategies.  © 2024 IEEE.",6G metaverse services; cooperative deep reinforcement learning; diversified QoS requirements; multi-objective routing
Adaptive Social Metaverse Streaming Based on Federated Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth optimization. To address these issues, we propose adaptive social metaverse streaming (ASMS), a novel streaming system based on federated multiagent proximal policy optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remain on local devices.  © 2014 IEEE.",Adaptive bit rate (ABR) streaming; extended reality (XR); federated learning (FL); multiagent reinforcement learning; social metaverse

Asynchronous Hybrid Reinforcement Learning for Latency and Reliability Optimization in the Metaverse Over Wireless Communications,"Technology advancements in wireless communications and high-performance Extended Reality (XR) have empowered the developments of the Metaverse. The demand for the Metaverse applications and hence, real-time digital twinning of real-world scenes is increasing. Nevertheless, the replication of 2D physical world images into 3D virtual objects is computationally intensive and requires computation offloading. The disparity in transmitted object dimension (2D as opposed to 3D) leads to asymmetric data sizes in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we consider an asynchronous joint UL-DL scenario where in the UL stage, the smaller data size of the physical world images captured by multiple extended reality users (XUs) will be uploaded to the Metaverse Console (MC) to be construed and rendered. In the DL stage, the larger-size 3D virtual objects need to be transmitted back to the XUs. We design a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm structure, namely Asynchronous Actors Hybrid Critic (AAHC), to optimize the decisions pertaining to computation offloading and channel assignment in the UL stage and optimize the DL transmission power in the DL stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to proposed baselines, AAHC obtains better solutions with satisfactory training time.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.",Metaverse; Reinforcement learning; resource allocation; ultra-reliable low-latency communication; wireless communications

Securing Distributed Computing in the Metaverse: A Balanced TGDH Encryption Scheme,"In this paper, we present a secure communication protocol based on a balanced Tree-based Group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) key management solution for secure distributed computing in metaverse. The novelty of this work is that our modified TGDH algorithm balances the tree while preserving the distributed, secure architecture of group re-keying. The balanced tree ensures optimized computation regardless of join or leave events. This paper also presents a portable Python application programming interface (API) for the implementation of this secured group key management algorithm. This API addresses a lack of existing open-source implementations of TGDH, specifically in distributed-system architecture.

The impact of eye gaze on social interactions of females in virtual reality: The mediating role of the uncanniness of avatars and the moderating role of task type,"The introduction of the Metaverse and the rise of social virtual reality platforms such as VRChat has led to increased communication and collaboration in virtual reality. As interactions in social virtual reality take place through avatars, the behaviour, and in particular the eye gaze of an avatar can have an impact on the user experience. However, it is still unclear which features of the user experience are most influenced. Therefore, this study used data from 44 female participants to investigate how avatar gaze behaviour (static eyes vs. real-time tracked eyes) affects their perceived quality of communication and the amount of one-sided eye contact participants make during a communicative or collaborative task in virtual reality. In addition, the study investigated the mediating role of perceived avatar “uncanniness” (i.e., the finding that humanoid objects that imperfectly resemble real people evoke feelings of discomfort) in this relationship and the moderation effect of two multi-user scenarios (collaboration vs. communication). The results showed that uncanniness directly affected the perceived quality of communication. However, it did not significantly mediate the relationship between avatar eye gaze behaviour and the quality of communication or the amount of one-sided eye contact. Finally, there were no significant differences in user experience between the two scenarios. From this, we can conclude that the uncanniness of an avatar being interacted with in VR is not enough to hinder communication and collaboration in an immersive medium. And even if an avatar is perceived as uncanny, normative communication cues such as eye contact are still present. Notably, due to sample availability, the results of this study are based on a female-only sample. Thus, future research can benefit from exploring the outlined effects in a more gender-balanced sample. © 2023 The Author(s)",Avatar uncanniness; Collaboration; Communication; Eye tracking; Moderated mediation analysis; Multi-agent; Virtual reality

Smart Farm Security by Combining IoT Sensor Network and Virtualized Mycelium Network,"In today's world, merging sensor-based security systems with contemporary principles has become crucial. As we witness the ever-growing number of interconnected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is imperative to have robust and trustworthy security measures in place. In this paper, we examine the idea of virtualizing the communication infrastructure for smart farming in the context of IoT. Our approach utilizes a metaverse-based framework that mimics natural processes such as mycelium network growth communication with a security-concept-based srtificial immune system (AIS) and transaction models of a multi-agent system (MAS). The mycelium, a bridge that transfers nutrients from one plant to another, is an underground network (IoT below ground) that can interconnect multiple plants. Our objective is to study and simulate the mycelium's behavior, which serves as an underground IoT, and we anticipate that the simulation results, supported by diverse aspects, can be a reference for future IoT network development. A proof of concept is presented, demonstrating the capabilities of such a virtualized network for dedicated sensor communication and easy reconfiguration for various needs.",artificial immune system; Internet-of-Things; metaverse; multi-agent system; mycelium; sensor network; smart farming
Improving End-To-End Latency Fairness Using a Reinforcement-Learning-Based Network Scheduler,"In services such as metaverse, which should provide a constant quality of service (QoS) regardless of the user’s physical location, the end-to-end (E2E) latency must be fairly distributed over any flow in the network. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduler for minimizing the maximum network E2E latency. The RL model used the double deep Q-network (DDQN) with the prioritized experience replay (PER). In order to see the performance change according to the type of RL agent, we implemented a single-agent environment where the controller is an agent and a multi-agent environment where each node is an agent. Since the agents were unable to identify E2E latencies in the multi-agent environment, the state and reward were formulated using the estimated E2E latencies. To precisely evaluate the RL-based scheduler, we set out benchmark algorithms to compare with which a network-arrival-time-based heuristic algorithm (NAT-HA) and a maximum-estimated-delay-based heuristic algorithm (MED-HA). The RL-based scheduler, first-in-first-out (FIFO), round-robin (RR), NAT-HA, and MED-HA were compared through large-scale simulations on four network topologies. The simulation results in fixed-packet generation scenarios showed that our proposal, the RL-based scheduler, achieved the minimization of maximum E2E latency in all the topologies. In other scenarios with random flow generation, the RL-based scheduler and MED-HA showed the lowest maximum E2E latency for all topologies. Depending on the topology, the maximum E2E latency of NAT-HA was equal to or larger than that of the RL-based scheduler. In terms of fairness, the RL-based scheduler showed a higher level of fairness than that of FIFO and RR. NAT-HA had similar or lower fairness than the RL-based scheduler depending on the topology, and MED-HA had the same level of fairness as the RL-based scheduler. © 2023 by the authors.",double-deep Q-learning; end-to-end latency; fairness; min-max criterion; prioritized experience replay; reinforcement learning
Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Avatar Migration in AIoT-Enabled Vehicular Metaverses With Trajectory Prediction,"Avatars, as promising digital assistants in Vehicular Metaverses, can enable drivers and passengers to immerse in 3-D virtual spaces, serving as a practical emerging example of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in intelligent vehicular environments. The immersive experience is achieved through seamless human-avatar interaction, e.g., augmented reality navigation, which requires intensive resources that are inefficient and impractical to process on intelligent vehicles locally. Fortunately, offloading avatar tasks to roadside units (RSUs) or cloud servers for remote execution can effectively reduce resource consumption. However, the high mobility of vehicles, the dynamic workload of RSUs, and the heterogeneity of RSUs pose novel challenges to making avatar migration decisions. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a dynamic migration framework for avatar tasks based on real-time trajectory prediction and multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Specifically, we propose a model to predict the future trajectories of intelligent vehicles based on their historical data, indicating the future workloads of RSUs. Based on the expected workloads of RSUs, we formulate the avatar task migration problem as a long-term mixed-integer programming problem. To tackle this problem efficiently, the problem is transformed into a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and solved by multiple DRL agents with hybrid continuous and discrete actions in decentralized. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the latency of executing avatar tasks by around 25% without prediction and 30% with prediction and enhance user immersive experiences in the AIoT-enabled Vehicular Metaverse (AeVeM).  © 2023 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT); avatar; Metaverses; multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL); service migration; trajectory prediction
Distributed deep reinforcement learning-based coordination performance optimization method for proton exchange membrane fuel cell system,"A proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a multi-input multi-output nonlinear complicated system, the output power and operating efficiency of which are affected by various operating variables. To achieve coordinated control of multiple operating variables and thus improve the stability, performance, and efficiency of the PEMFC power system, a data-driven power coordination management method is proposed. Furthermore, a metaverse-based multiagent double delay deep deterministic policy gradient (MET-MADDPG) algorithm is also presented. The design of this algorithm is structured on the concept of the metaverse in that it employs different metaverses during pre-learning and combines imitation learning and curriculum learning to enable agents in different combinations to be fully trained in different environments to improve coordination strategy robustness. In this algorithm, the hydrogen controller, air controller, water pump controller and radiator controller are regarded as four agents; the objective of the training is to enable agents with their different goals to coordinate.

Human-Centric Resource Allocation for the Metaverse With Multiaccess Edge Computing,"Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) is a promising solution to the computation-intensive, low-latency rendering tasks of the metaverse. However, how to optimally allocate limited communication and computation resources at the edge to a large number of users in the metaverse is quite challenging. In this article, we propose an adaptive edge resource allocation method based on multiagent soft actor-critic with graph convolutional networks (SAC-GCN). Specifically, SAC-GCN models the multiuser metaverse environment as a graph where each agent is denoted by a node. Each agent learns the interplay between agents by graph convolutional networks with a self-attention mechanism to further determine the resource usage for one user in the metaverse. The effectiveness of SAC-GCN is demonstrated through the analysis of user experience, balance of resource allocation, and resource utilization rate by taking a virtual city park metaverse as an example. Experimental results indicate that SAC-GCN outperforms other resource allocation methods in improving overall user experience, balancing resource allocation, and increasing resource utilization rate by at least 27%, 11%, and 8%, respectively.  © 2023 IEEE.",Attention mechanism; extended reality (XR); graph convolutional network; multiagent reinforcement learning
Joint Quantum Reinforcement Learning and Stabilized Control for Spatio-Temporal Coordination in Metaverse,"In order to build realistic metaverse systems, enabling high synchronization between physical-space and virtual meta-space is essentially required. For this purpose, this paper proposes a novel system-wide coordination algorithm for high synchronization under characteristics (i.e., highly realistic meta-space construction under the constraints of physical-space). The proposed algorithm consists of the following three stages. The first stage is quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning (QMARL)-based scheduling for low-delay temporal-synchronization using differentiated age-of-information (AoI) during data gathering in physical-space by observers for meta-space construction. This is beneficial for scalability according to action dimension reduction in reinforcement learning computation. The second stage is for creating virtual contents under delay constraints in meta-space based on the gathered data. When rendering regions that have received more user attention, avatar-popularity is considered for spatio-synchronization. Thus, a stabilized control mechanism is designed for time-average reality quality maximization for each region. The last stage is for caching based on avatar-popularity and AoI which can be helpful in constructing low-delay realistic meta-space. Furthermore, the concept of AoI is divided into two separate sub-concepts of physical AoI and virtual AoI such that the AoI in virtual meta-space can be thoroughly implemented.  © 2024 IEEE.",Age-of-Information; metaverse; quantum reinforcement learning; synchronization

A Novel Multi-Objective Routing Scheme based on Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Metaverse Services in Fixed 6G,"The 6th Generation Fixed networks (F6G) with holographic communication and omni-directional sensory coverage is expected to arrive in 2030. Due to the characteristics of cross-integration between the physical and digital worlds, metaverse has been widely recognized as an important application in F6G to be utilized in all walks of life in the future. However, the metaverse applications will generate diversified communication services with differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, which will be a great challenge for F6G to develop End-to-End (E2E) customized transmission strategies. Traditional single metric-based routing algorithms cannot efficiently orchestrate the network resources to meet the diversified QoS requirements. To solve the above problems, we propose a Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Co-MARL) routing algorithm, which measures the differentiated QoS demands through a generic utility function to facilitate multiple agents to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The simulation results show our scheme outperforms the traditional routing algorithm in meeting the diversified QoS requirements.  © 2023 IEEE.",Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning; differentiated QoS requirements; F6G; multi-objective routing
Mobile Edge Adversarial Detection for Digital Twinning to the Metaverse with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Real-time Digital Twinning of physical world scenes onto the Metaverse is necessary for a myriad of applications such as augmented-reality (AR) assisted driving. In AR assisted driving, physical environment scenes are first captured by Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and are uploaded to the Metaverse. A central Metaverse Map Service Provider (MMSP) will aggregate information from all IoVs to develop a central Metaverse Map. Information from the Metaverse Map can then be downloaded into individual IoVs on demand and be delivered as AR scenes to the driver. However, the growing interest in developing AR assisted driving applications which relies on digital twinning invites adversaries. These adversaries may place physical adversarial patches on physical world objects such as cars, signboards, or on roads, seeking to contort the virtual world digital twin. Hence, there is a need to detect these physical world adversarial patches. Nevertheless, as real-time, accurate detection of adversarial patches is compute-intensive, these physical world scenes have to be offloaded to the Metaverse Map Base Stations (MMBS) for computation. Hence in our work, we considered an environment with moving Internet of Vehicles (IoV), uploading real-time physical world scenes to the MMBSs. We formulated a realistic joint variable optimization problem where the MMSPs' objective is to maximize adversarial patch detection mean average precision (mAP), while minimizing the computed AR scene up-link transmission latency and IoVs' up-link transmission idle count, through optimizing the IoV-MMBS allocation and IoV up-link scene resolution selection. We proposed a Heterogeneous Action Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) (discrete-continuous) algorithm to tackle the proposed problem. Extensive experiments shows HAPPO outperforms baseline models when compared against key metrics.  © 2023 IEEE.",adversarial; augmented reality; digital twin; Internet of Vehicles; Metaverse; multi-agent; reinforcement learning; resource allocation
Spatio-Temporal Multi-Metaverse Dynamic Streaming for Hybrid Quantum-Classical Systems,"According to the challenges related to the limited availability of quantum bits (qubits) in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), the immediate replacement of all components in existing network architectures with quantum computing devices may not be practical. As a result, implementing a hybrid quantum-classical system is regarded as one of effective strategies. In hybrid quantum-classical systems, quantum computing devices can be used for computation-intensive applications, such as massive scheduling in dynamic environments. Furthermore, one of most popular network applications is advanced social media services such as metaverse. Accordingly, this paper proposes an advanced multi-metaverse dynamic streaming algorithm in hybrid quantum-classical systems. For this purpose, the proposed algorithm consists of three stages. For the first stage, three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data gathering should be conducted using spatially scheduled observing devices from physical-spaces for constructing virtual multiple meta-spaces in metaverse server. This is for massive scheduling over dynamic situations, i.e., quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning-based scheduling is utilized for scheduling dimension reduction into a logarithmic-scale. For the second stage, a temporal low-delay metaverse server's processor scheduler is designed for region-popularity-aware multiple virtual meta-spaces rendering contents allocation via modified bin-packing with hard real-time constraints. Lastly, a novel dynamic dynamic streaming algorithm is proposed for high-quality, differentiated, and stabilized meta-spaces rendering contents delivery to individual users via Lyapunov optimization theory. Our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed spatio-temporal algorithm outperforms benchmarks in various aspects over hybrid quantum-classical systems.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",dynamic streaming; Hybrid quantum-classical systems; metaverse; quantum deep learning
QoE-Oriented Cooperative VR Rendering and Dynamic Resource Leasing in Metaverse,"The rise of the Metaverse has ushered in a new era of social networking, offering users deeply engaging spaces to connect and participate in social activities. However, rendering these virtual environments is resource-intensive. With many users accessing simultaneously and requiring diverse Metaverse services, optimizing Metaverse resources to deliver the best quality-of-experience (QoE) for users is a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a cooperative virtual reality (VR) rendering and dynamic resource leasing mechanism to address this issue. Specifically, we first introduce a cooperative VR scene pre-rendering framework between users and Planets (i.e., edge servers hosting users), and establish a new user QoE metric named EdgeVRQoE which considers both rendering delay and visual quality. We formulate the multidimensional rendering resources (e.g., GPU, CPU, and outbound bandwidth) leasing problem between Planets and users as a double-layer decision problem, and devise a hybrid action multi-agent reinforcement learning-based dynamic resource auction mechanism to efficiently allocate limited resources of Planets in a distributed and adaptive manner. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the representatives in user QoE and resource utilization efficiency. Particularly, the proposed scheme shows at least an 18-fold improvement in QoE over other schemes, demonstrating its capability in providing immersive Metaverse experiences. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",cooperative VR rendering; dynamic resource leasing; MARL; Metaverse; QoE
Scalable Consensus Over Finite Capacities in Multiagent IoT Ecosystems,"In the real world, consensus achievement is an adaptive and evolutionary process. Tailor-made mechanisms are engaging in the light of disputes to resolve emerging contradictions between the atoms. Most of the dominant blockchain architectures tend to oversee this fact. They come integrated with rigid, overkilling consensus-achievement procedures, which, in many cases, are not necessary or significantly beneficial. They often raise overwhelming demands on the nodes and prohibit the deployment of fully distributed and peer blockchain operation in the IoT world. Still, for the IoT ecosystems and the metaverse to become self-sustainable and self-evolving, robust validity mechanisms must be embedded in the atomic scale. This work investigates the process of building and sustaining scalable consensus policies over the trivial atomic capacities of the IoT ecosystems. For this, we deploy the IoT microblockchain framework as an atomic consistency tier and we define a primary set of validity rules that every node can easily carry out. The initial concept relies on Gödel's incompleteness theorems and K. Friston's free energy principle and is investigated under the perspectives of graph and game theory. To study the dynamic behavior of the system, a competitive game among the nodes is run. The Proof of Existence (PoE) is utilized as a universal proofing case. Its feasibility is demonstrated, and its complexity is analyzed under various system considerations. The findings prove that finite-capacity atoms can collectively and efficiently support verifiable validity and scalable consensus in the evolutionary IoT ecosystems and the metaverse, even under conditions of high diversity, trivial capacity, and eventual consistency.  © 2014 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence (AI)-intensive multiagent systems; evolutionary systems; IoT microblockchain; IoT sustainable transactional trust; peer IoT ecosystems; rational metaverse; reality modeling; scalable consensus; validity in IoT ecosystems
Efficient Twin Migration in Vehicular Metaverses: Multi-Agent Split Deep Reinforcement Learning with Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Generation,"Vehicle Twins (VTs) as digital representations of vehicles can provide users with immersive experiences in vehicular metaverse applications, e.g., Augmented Reality (AR) navigation and embodied intelligence. VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",deep reinforcement learning; Digital Twins; service migration; vehicular metaverse

Multiple-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Avatar Migration in Vehicular Metaverses,"Vehicular Metaverses are widely considered as the next Internet revolution to build a 3D virtual world with immersive virtual-real interaction for passengers and drivers. In vehicular Metaverse applications, avatars are digital representations of on-board users to obtain and manage immersive vehicular services (i.e., avatar tasks) in Metaverses and the data they generate. However, traditional Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data management solutions have serious data security risks and privacy protection. Fortunately, blockchain-based Web 3.0 enables avatars to have an ownership identity to securely manage the data owned by users in a decentralized and transparent manner. To ensure users' immersive experiences and securely manage their data, avatar tasks often require significant computing resources. Therefore, it is impractical for the vehicles to process avatar tasks locally, massive computation resources are needed to support the avatar tasks. To this end, offloading avatar tasks to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs) is a promising solution to avoid computation overload. To ensure real-time and continuous Metaverse services, the avatar tasks should be migrated among the RSUs when the vehicle navigation. It is challenging for the vehicles to independently decide whether migrate or not according to current and future avatar states. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new avatar task migration framework for vehicular Metaverses. We then formulate the avatar task migration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and apply a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) algorithm to dynamically make migration decisions for avatar tasks. Numerous results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines for avatar task migration and enables immersive vehicular Metaverse services.  © 2023 ACM.",avatar migration; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; vehicular Metaverse

Blockchain-Empowered Multi-Domain Resource Trading in TN-NTN 6G Networks: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent DRL Approach,"The advent of 6G networks promises transformative advances in communication technologies, ushering in an era of unprecedented connectivity, low-latency communication, and ubiquitous computing. However, one of the key challenges in realizing the full potential of 6G lies in efficiently managing and trading resources across diverse domains in terrestrial and non-terrestrial integrated networks (TN-NTN). In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-domain resource trading approach that integrates blockchain technology, hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (HMADRL), and multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg games to address this challenge. HMADRL provides an intelligent and adaptable framework for resource requesters and provider agents to learn optimal resource allocation methods in multiple domains. The MLMF Stackelberg game framework represents the strategic interactions between virtual service providers (SPs), network operators, and computing resource providers to enable them to make dynamic resource allocation and pricing decisions. This hierarchical decision-making strategy ensures a structured bargaining mechanism where leaders optimize their revenue by setting resource pricing and followers strategically decide on their resource-buying strategies. In the proposed scheme, the blockchain includes smart contracts that autonomously execute resource trading agreements, ensuring that transactions are tamper-proof and executed according to predefined rules. The proposed method optimizes the system's utility by dynamically adjusting the pricing strategy to changing resource demands. The simulation results show that our proposed HMADRL algorithm increases the utility by 19.645%, 33.018%, and 48.791% compared to the modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), MADDPG, and DDPG algorithms, respectively.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.",Aerial-MEC; consortium blockchain; HMADRL; Metaverse; network slicing; resource trading; Stackelberg game; TN-NTN

When Metaverses Meet Vehicle Road Cooperation: Multiagent DRL-Based Stackelberg Game for Vehicular Twins Migration,"Vehicular metaverses represent emerging paradigms arising from the convergence of vehicle road cooperation, metaverse, and Augmented Intelligence of Things. Users engaging with vehicular metaverses (VMUs) gain entry by consistently updating their vehicular twins (VTs), which are deployed on roadside units (RSUs) in proximity. The constrained RSU coverage and the consistently moving vehicles necessitate the continuous migration of VTs between RSUs through vehicle road cooperation, ensuring uninterrupted immersion services for VMUs. Nevertheless, the VT migration process faces challenges in obtaining adequate bandwidth resources from RSUs for timely migration, posing a resource trading problem among RSUs. In this article, we tackle this challenge by formulating a game-theoretic incentive mechanism with multileader multifollower, incorporating insights from social-awareness and queueing theory to optimize VT migration. To validate the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), we apply the backward induction method. Theoretical solutions for this equilibrium are then obtained through the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) algorithm. Moreover, owing to incomplete information caused by the requirements for privacy protection, we proposed a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm named multiagent long short-term memory-based proximal policy optimization (MALPPO). MALPPO facilitates learning the SE without requiring private information from others, relying solely on past experiences. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our MALPPO-based incentive mechanism outperforms baseline approaches significantly, showcasing rapid convergence and achieving the highest reward. © 2014 IEEE.",Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM); deep reinforcement learning (DRL); metaverse; multileader multifollower Stackelberg game; vehicle road cooperation
Semantic Information Marketing in the Metaverse: A Learning-Based Contract Theory Framework,"In this paper, we address the problem of designing incentive mechanisms by a virtual service provider (VSP) to hire sensing IoT devices to sell their sensing data to help creating and rendering the digital copy of the physical world in the Metaverse. Due to the limited bandwidth, we propose to use semantic extraction algorithms to reduce the delivered data by the sensing IoT devices. Nevertheless, mechanisms to hire sensing IoT devices to share their data with the VSP and then deliver the constructed digital twin to the Metaverse users are vulnerable to adverse selection problem. The adverse selection problem, which is caused by information asymmetry between the system entities, becomes harder to solve when the private information of the different entities are multi-dimensional. We propose a novel iterative contract design and use a new variant of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve the modelled multi-dimensional contract problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct extensive simulations and measure several key performance metrics of the contract for the Metaverse. Our results show that our designed iterative contract is able to incentivize the participants to interact truthfully, which maximizes the profit of the VSP with minimal individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) violation rates. Furthermore, the proposed learning-based iterative contract framework has limited access to the private information of the participants, which is to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind in addressing the problem of adverse selection in incentive mechanisms.  © 2023 IEEE.",age of information; contract theory; deep reinforcement learning; Digital twin; semantic communication

AI-Enabled Unmanned Agents for Real-Time 3D Scene Analysis in Military Operations,"This paper presents an innovative system for dynamic 3D scene perception tailored for battlefield environments, leveraging unmanned intelligent agents equipped with binocular vision and inertial measurement units (IMUs). The system processes binocular video streams and IMU data to deploy advanced deep learning techniques, including instance segmentation and dense optical flow prediction, facilitated by a specially curated target dataset. The integration of a ResNet101+FPN backbone for model training results in a combat unit type recognition accuracy of 91.8%, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.808, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.606. A dynamic scene localization and perception module utilizes these deep learning outputs to refine pose estimations and enhance localization accuracy by overcoming environmental complexities and motion-induced errors, typically associated with SLAM methodologies. Application tests conducted within a simulated battlefield metaverse environment demonstrate a 44.2% improvement in self-localization accuracy over traditional ORB-SLAM2 Stereo methods. The system efficiently tracks and annotates dynamic and static battlefield ele-ments, continuously updating global maps with precise data on agent poses and target move-ments. This work not only addresses the dynamic complexity and potential information loss in battlefield scenarios but also lays a foundational framework for future enhancements in network capabilities and environment reconstruction methodologies.

Tiny Multiagent DRL for Twins Migration in UAV Metaverses: A Multileader Multifollower Stackelberg Game Approach,"The synergy between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and metaverses is giving rise to an emerging paradigm named UAV metaverses, which create a unified ecosystem that blends physical and virtual spaces, transforming drone interaction and virtual exploration. UAV twins (UTs), as the digital twins of UAVs that revolutionize UAV applications by making them more immersive, realistic, and informative, are deployed and updated on ground base stations, e.g., roadside units (RSUs), to offer metaverse services for UAV metaverse users (UMUs). Due to the dynamic mobility of UAVs and limited communication coverages of RSUs, it is essential to perform real-time UT migration to ensure seamless immersive experiences for UMUs. However, selecting appropriate RSUs and optimizing the required bandwidth is challenging for achieving reliable and efficient UT migration. To address the challenges, we propose a tiny machine learning-based Stackelberg game framework based on pruning techniques for efficient UT migration in UAV metaverses. Specifically, we formulate a multileader multifollower Stackelberg model considering a new immersion metric of UMUs in the utilities of UAVs. Then, we design a Tiny multiagent deep reinforcement learning (Tiny MADRL) algorithm to obtain the tiny networks representing the optimal game solution. Specifically, the actor-critic network leverages the pruning techniques to reduce the number of network parameters and achieve model size and computation reduction, allowing for efficient implementation of Tiny MADRL.

Securing the Metaverse: The Intersection of ML-Based Oracles and Blockchain Technology,"The integration of blockchain and machine learning (ML) in decentralized systems has revolutionized the operational potential of smart contracts, especially in dynamic and interactive environments such as the metaverse. Smart contracts leverage blockchain technology to enable secure, decentralized, and transparent automation of agreements without intermediaries. However, their reliability often depends on external data sources, known as blockchain oracles, which are prone to tampering and manipulation due to their operation outside the blockchain. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel architecture, MARL-RSS (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Ring Signature Scheme), designed to enhance blockchain security and ensure the trustworthiness of oracle networks. MARL-RSS integrates Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning techniques to dynamically detect and isolate malicious oracles, ensuring data integrity and system resilience. Furthermore, the integration of a Ring Signature Scheme (RSS) guarantees oracle anonymity and authenticity, enabling secure data sharing while preserving privacy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MARL- RSS in detecting malicious oracles with high accuracy while maintaining low false positive rates. The RSS mechanism introduces minimal overhead while ensuring privacy and authenticity.

Blockchain-Based Pseudonym Management for Vehicle Twin Migrations in Vehicular Edge Metaverse,"Driven by the great advances in metaverse and edge computing technologies, vehicular edge metaverses are expected to disrupt the current paradigm of intelligent transportation systems. As highly computerized avatars of vehicular metaverse users (VMUs), the vehicle twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are high-efficiency and cost-effective, showcasing their promising applications in vehicular edge metaverses.  © 2024 IEEE.",Cross-chain; deep reinforcement learning; pseudonym management; twin migration; vehicular metaverse
Environmental Cognition-Driven Hierarchical Decision-Making for Air-Ground Collaborative Communication,"The unparalleled communication and sensing capabilities of the 6th generation (6G) networks can fulfill the diverse requirements of emerging scenarios like the metaverse.

In the meanwhile, to overcome the limitations of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods in addressing the increasing complexities of multi-task and multi-granularity decision-making, a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) method based on the actor-critic (AC) framework is proposed to quick decision-making for air-ground collaborative communication.

QoI-Aware Mobile Crowdsensing for Metaverse by Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Metaverse is expected to provide mobile users with emerging applications both in regular situation like intelligent transportation services and in emergencies like wireless search and disaster response. These applications are usually associated with stringent quality-of-information (QoI) requirements like throughput and age-of-information (AoI), which can be further guaranteed by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations (BSs) to compensate the existing 5G infrastructures.

However, the heterogeneous caching hardware, communication environments, and frequent network dynamics make the optimization of content caching policy highly complicated. Firstly, considering all LEO satellites as caching satellites can lead to content duplication and radio interference, causing storage waste and NTN transmission quality deterioration. Secondly, how to provide customized QoS by intra-layer and inter-layer cooperative caching in such complicated environments remains an open issue. Thus, we propose a Delay-Motivated Ant Colony Optimization (DM-ACO) scheme to select caching LEO satellites with reduced system propagation delay. Then, the Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Hierarchical Caching and Asynchronous Updating (MADRL-HCAU) strategy is designed to manage the caching capacity of LEO satellites and UAVs, providing customized services for CAVs and dispensing the peak traffic. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can not only effectively accelerate the caching refreshing and content downloading process but also significantly reduce the packet drop and improve the cache hit ratio. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",ant colony optimization; asynchronous updating; hierarchical caching; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; Non-terrestrial networks

Reputation-Based Trust Assessment of Transacting Service Components,"We witness a paradigm shift where entities such as software applications, people, businesses and service providers increasingly interact in virtual rather than physical environments, such as social media, social commerce, and the metaverses. A key issue that emerges in such environments is how one entity can trust another. Here, the concept of trust is considered as a meta-requirement, that is, the level of belief a service requestor has that a service provider will provide the service in a way that meets the requestor's expectations. We refer to the service offering entities as service providers (SPs) and the service requesting entities as service clients (SCs). In this paper, we propose a technique that allows for evaluating trust and assigning reputation to various service providers by considering first their ability to fulfill their clients' expectations or policies, and second the reputation other service clients have, when acting as recommenders for the aforementioned service providers. In this work, service clients and service providers are considered as virtual entities that coordinate with each other, and may include physical users, avatars, micro-services, software agents, smart contracts or any other distributed inter-networked resource, without making any assumptions as to what a service client or a service provider entity is as long as it participates in an interaction. © 2023 IEEE.",Distributed Components; Metaverse; Multi-agent Systems; Reputation Systems; Service-oriented Computing; Trust
CollaborativeBEV: Collaborative bird eye view for reconstructing crowded environment,"Constructing a virtual world for the Metaverse based on real-world data is crucial, yet creating virtual environments for crowded scenes poses challenges in accurately tracking individuals using egocentric wearable cameras due to occlusions caused by crowded pedestrians. To address this, we propose a collaborative perception strategy that leverages multiple agents equipped with multi-view cameras to construct an occupancy map for a crowded environment. To fuse the multi-view perceptions of multiple agents, we propose a Collaborative Bird Eye View fusion network, called CollaborativeBEV (C-BEV), in which, we leverage a depth-based BEV network as a feature extractor, and propose a feature enhancement module to improve perception fusion in overlapping area. A designed loss function is introduced to address data imbalance during training, and a BEV enhancement strategy is proposed to augment the sample pool for training the BEV decoder. Experiment on the Sean2.0 dataset demonstrates that our C-BEV method performs better than the baseline method in terms of a 5.3% IoU increase. Our code will be released on github. https://github.com/RYaNzzZ1/CollaborativeBEV. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",3D reconstruction; Collaborative BEV; Metaverse; Occupancy map; Point cloud understanding
Resource Allocation for Metaverse Experience Optimization: A Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning Approach,"In the Metaverse, real-time, concurrent services such as virtual classrooms and immersive gaming require local graphic rendering to maintain low latency. However, the limited processing power and battery capacity of user devices make it challenging to balance Quality of Experience (QoE) and terminal energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) regarding power control and rendering capacity allocation by formulating it as a multi-objective optimization problem. This problem aims to minimize energy consumption while maximizing Meta-Immersion (MI), a metric that integrates objective network performance with subjective user perception. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with User-Object-Attention (M2ERL-UOA) algorithm. The algorithm employs a prediction-driven evolutionary learning mechanism for multi-agents, coupled with optimized rendering capacity decisions for virtual objects. The algorithm can yield a superior Pareto front that attains the Nash equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can generate Pareto fronts, effectively adapts to dynamic user preferences, and significantly reduces decision-making time compared to several benchmarks. © 2024 IEEE.

Link-Weight Adjustment for Efficient Link-State Multicast Routing with MARL,"Along with the rapid increase of new applications involving multiple participants, such as metaverse, multicast traffic engineering (TE) has recently attracted significant attention. The optimal multicast TE for offered traffic can be obtained using link-state routing protocols with a proper link weight setting. However, optimizing the link weights for such link-state multicast routing protocols according to the offered traffic in real-time is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we provide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for finding the link metrics that allow link-state multicast routing protocols to achieve optimal traffic engineering. To meet the real-time requirement, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) solution to the problem of link weights adjustment to achieve efficient multicast routing in a distributed fashion. In our design, the agents collaborate and communicate with the others in the local region and learn from their experiences to determine the best action to minimize the overall network cost. Our proposed solution is evaluated on a simulation of various traffic profiles and compared with the traditional manually configured link weights and a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based heuristic solution. Experimental results show the advantages of our solutions in reducing network cost, and suggest the potential of using MARL in achieving efficient multicast traffic engineering. © 2023 IEEE.",MARL; Multicast routing
VRRC: Empowering Metaverse-Infused Driving Experience for Multiplatoon Vehicles Through IoRT,"The emergence of metaverse applications and services heralds a new era of immersive driving experiences in future vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This unprecedented metaverse-infused driving experience, however, requires high-throughput transmissions for real-time high-quality 360° video streaming, which challenges today's limited bandwidth resources provisioned by wireless communication infrastructure. To this end, this article introduces virtual road, real connection (VRRC), a novel framework for enhancing the metaverse-infused driving experience in VANET through the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). In the face of limited bandwidth resources, VRRC effectively addresses the challenge of high-throughput demand from two key perspectives. First, VRRC reduces redundant transmission by implementing a graph neural network (GNN)-based vehicle clustering method for dynamic multicast group formation, taking into account both the geographical status of vehicles and their communication patterns. Second, VRRC aggregates bandwidth resources across various channels by employing a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based multipath packet scheduling policy to adapt to heterogeneous channel conditions and dynamic vehicular mobility. Extensive experiments with real-world vehicular traces validate the effectiveness of VRRC and demonstrate its outperformance in reducing redundant traffic by 54% and improving overall throughput by 28%. VRRC represents a substantial leap forward in the integration of the metaverse experience into VANET. © 2024 IEEE.",Graph neural networks (GNNs); metaverse; multipath TCP (MPTCP); reinforcement learning; vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)

Parallel tourism:foundation intelligence driven smart trip services; [平行旅游：基础智能驱动的智慧出游服务],"Tourism, as an activity that satisfies people’s desire for diverse life experiences and knowledge, has had profound impacts on the economy, culture, and other fields. However, with the rapid development of technologies, such as the Internet of Things and multimodal large language models, traditional tourism is unable to meet the demand for intelligent and personalized travel experiences. To address this, this paper proposes an interactive personalized tourism service system based on the concept of parallel intelligence, utilizing the ACP approach and multimodal large language models. The system constructs a comprehensive tourism model and leverages retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent collaboration systems to create a new paradigm for personalized tourism services.

Blockchain-enabled dispersed computing paradigm in Web 3.0 metaverse,"The metaverse is rapidly gaining momentum, thanks to its inherent capabilities to create an immersive virtual environment that runs in parallel to the physical world. At the same time, it raises new technical challenges due to its unique characteristics. On the one hand, metaverse applications are composed of multiple computing sub-tasks, and performing these sub-tasks sequentially can hinder computational efficiency. On the other hand, current centralized task offloading for metaverse applications is contrary to the core concept of Web 3.0. Moreover, fair incentives for all participants are not fully considered. To address these issues, a new computing paradigm for metaverse is required. Hence, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Intelligent Dispersed Computing Framework (BIDC). In this paper, we first design a two-layered architecture and model the sub-tasks as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) by utilizing their dependent relations. Inspired by the interconnection of blocks in blockchain, BIDC transforms the execution process of sub-tasks into a mining process, cleverly integrating task computation with mining. On this basis, Mining Mechanism and Main Chain Confirmation Mechanisms are presented, to ensure the efficiency of task offloading and the fairness of reward distribution. Then BIDC transforms the overhead time minimization problem into a multi-party mining problem. By leveraging Actor-Critic-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, every device can dynamically adjust its own mining strategy to achieve the lowest latency. At last, experimental results demonstrate BIDC's reliability, scalability, and superior service quality compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Deep reinforcement learning; Edge computing; Task offloading
"AI-Assisted Edge Caching for Metaverse of Connected and Automated Vehicles: Proposal, Challenges, and Future Perspectives","The upcoming metaverse will significantly promote the safety and efficiency of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) as well as intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) with immersive information exchange between the parallel digital and physical worlds. To enable the virtual world to better reflect the physical world, a great deal of sensed information in types of text, pictures, voice, and videos should be fetched by metaverse applications. Edge caching has been considered to improve transmission quality and data protection by storing the needed contents near users rather than in the cloud. However, qualified edge caching for the metaverse of CAVs (meta-CAVs) and metaverse of ITSs (meta-ITSs) is challenged by ubiquitous mobilities, diversified requirements, dynamic content popularity, and heterogeneous infrastructure. In this article, we elaborate on the requirements and challenges of edge caching for meta-CAVs and meta-ITSs. We then discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in edge caching to improve the performance and security of meta-CAVs and meta-ITSs. To evaluate our idea, a case study with the Multi-Agent Federated Reinforcement Learning (MAFRL)-based intelligent edge caching is provided. Some perspective research directions are given to illuminate more ideas.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",
An Intelligent Hierarchical Caching and Asynchronous Updating Scheme for 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks,"With the advantages of seamless coverage and ubiq-uitous connections, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) composed of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can provide content caching services to reduce End-to-End (E2E) delay and alleviate the network traffic for future 6G applications including autonomous driving, eHealth, and metaverse. However, the ultra-density of LEO satellites complicates the selection of caching nodes, while the heteroge-neous caching hardware and communication environments make optimization of content deployment highly difficult. To address these issues, we propose an intelligent hierarchical caching and asynchronous updating scheme. Specifically, a Delay-Motivated Ant Colony Optimization (DM-ACO) scheme is first adopted to select the caching LEO satellites to reduce the system propagation delay. Then, the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Hi-erarchical Caching and Asynchronous Updating (MARL-HCAU) strategy is proposed to meet caching service demands. Simulation results illustrate that compared with the benchmarks, the overall cache hit ratio increases by 14.2 % with the reduced packet drop rate and transmission delay by 8.78 % and 0.94s, respectively.  © 2024 IEEE.",ant colony optimization; hierarchical caching; Non-Terrestrial Networks; reinforcement learning

Enabling the Wireless Metaverse via Semantic Multiverse Communication,"Metaverse over wireless networks is an emerging use case of the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, posing unprecedented challenges in terms of its multi-modal data transmissions with stringent latency and reliability requirements. Towards enabling this wireless metaverse, in this article we propose a novel semantic communication (SC) framework by decomposing the metaverse into human/machine agent-specific semantic multiverses (SMs). An SM stored at each agent comprises a semantic encoder and a generator, leveraging recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI). To improve communication efficiency, the encoder learns the semantic representations (SRs) of multi-modal data, while the generator learns how to manipulate them for locally rendering scenes and interactions in the metaverse. Since these learned SMs are biased towards local environments, their success hinges on synchronizing heterogeneous SMs in the background while communicating SRs in the foreground, turning the wireless metaverse problem into the problem of semantic multiverse communication (SMC). Based on this SMC architecture, we propose several promising algorithmic and analytic tools for modeling and designing SMC, ranging from distributed learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to signaling games and symbolic AI. © 2023 IEEE.",extended reality (XR); federated learning; Metaverse; multi-agent reinforcement learning; semantic communication; signaling game; split learning; symbolic artificial intelligence
