abstract = {When one hears the word Metaverse, it is automatically associated with millions of users, immersive experiences and its potential to change our lives. But, what enables the Metaverse to function at such a scale? This talk will present the different challenges associated with handling 55 million daily users within the Roblox Metaverse. From addressing user Quality of Experience, to distributed architecture, programming model and scheduling, we will cover the entire stack underneath. In particular, I will put special attention into the AI-Metaverse relationship. On one hand, a large proportion of workloads are based on one or multiple ML/DL models and I will present the challenges of scaling them. On the other hand, I will explore infrastructure and service model challenges that can be addressed with AI, e.g. multi-resource and multi-datacenter scheduling with Reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Social metaverse with VR has been viewed as a paradigm shift for social media. However, most traditional VR social platforms ignore emerging characteristics in a metaverse, thereby failing to boost user satisfaction. In this paper, we explore a scenario of socializing in metaverse with VR, which brings major advantages over conventional social media: 1) leverage flexible display of users' 360-degree viewports to satisfy individual user interests, 2) ensure the user feelings of co-existence, 3) prevent view obstruction to help users find friends in crowds, and 4) support socializing with digital twins. Therefore, we formulate the Co-presence, and Occlusion-aware Metaverse User Recommendation (COMUR) problem to recommend a set of rendered players for users in social metaverse with VR. We prove COMUR is an NP-hard optimization problem and design a dual-module deep graph learning framework (COMURNet) to recommend appropriate users for viewport display. Experimental results on real social metaverse datasets and a user study with Occulus Quest 2 manifest that the proposed model outperforms baseline approaches by at least 36.7\% of solution quality.},

abstract = {A primary source of revenue for web platforms is digital advertising. Platforms typically maximize the effectiveness of advertising campaigns by exploiting user features (i.e., targeted advertising). However, performance can be further improved by leveraging user navigation history. In particular, the advent of new augmented reality platforms encourages users to spend a considerable amount of time in the same virtual environment, opening up the challenge of determining which ads to display and at which time of their experience. In this paper, we initiate the study of history-dependent advertising by providing a user model and optimized ad allocation algorithms. Our model assumes that users move through a series of scenes where they are exposed to ads. The performance of an ad may be influenced by various factors, such as the features of the scene in which it is displayed, the externalities of previously observed ads and the possibility that a user has already purchased the promoted product. We analyze the computational complexity of finding an optimal ad allocation for several model flavors and provide practical approximation algorithms with tight theoretical guarantees. We also discuss under which conditions our approximation algorithms are monotone according to Myerson's definition, thus leading to truthful auction mechanisms.},

abstract = {Designing auctions to incentivize buyers to invite new buyers via their social connections is a new trend in mechanism design[18]. The challenge is that buyers are competitors and we need to design proper incentives for them to invite each other. For selling a single item, many interesting mechanisms have been proposed. However, all the mechanisms require the seller or a third party to be trustworthy to execute the mechanisms. In addition, the owner of the mechanism will know all the connections of the network after the execution, which poses a potential privacy issue. Hence, distributed mechanisms to avoid the privacy issue are more appealing in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first distributed mechanism in social networks without revealing buyers' private connections to anyone, and it achieves complete decentralization that does not rely on any trustworthy third party. Moreover, the centralized reduction of our mechanism also offers a novel way to compute players' contributions compared to the existing solutions.},

We envision a Distributed Educational Agent Network (DEAN) of connected, trustworthy educational agents that securely communicate with each other to collectively carry out the above-mentioned tasks. We discuss the benefits and current and future challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed agent-assisted educational approach. Research and development of DEAN provide a unique opportunity for the agent community to design, implement and evaluate agent technologies in complex, large scale scenarios. In this paper, we also specify a proposal for a design of a DEAN agent, using skill development to monitor and drive education and career.},

abstract = {Over the past years, augmented reality (AR) based on mobile phones has gained great attention. When multiple phones are used in AR applications, collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is considered one of the enabling technologies, i.e., multiple mobile phones complete the localization and mapping through collaboration. However, the state-of-the-art collaborative SLAM systems not only suffer from the delays introduced by a high-complexity graph optimization problem, but also may exhibit varying levels of accuracy across dissimilar environments or different types of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a scalable and robust collaborative SLAM system, point-line-based Collaborative SLAM (ColSLAM). Technically, ColSLAM includes two innovative features that help achieve satisfactory scalability and robustness. First, a mapping cacher (MC) is designed for each agent on the server, which uses global keyframes to detect loop closures, updates the cached local map, and quickly responds to the agent's pose drifts. With MC, each agent's local pose is corrected using global knowledge in real-time. Secondly, to improve the robustness performance, ColSLAM employs point-line-fusion-based Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO), point-line-fusion-based NetVLAD loop detection, and an enhanced geometric verification and relative pose calculation method called PNPL. Empirical evaluations based on the EuRoc dataset and real degenerate environments demonstrate that ColSLAM outperforms the existing collaborative SLAM systems in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability.},

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), workers and cars can collaborate to accomplish sensing tasks, such as life detection task in disaster-stricken areas. In this paper, we explicitly address the route planning for a group of agents, including UAVs, workers, and cars, with the goal of maximizing the sensing task completion rate. we propose a MARL-based heterogeneous multi-agent route planning algorithm called MANF-RL-RP. The algorithm has made targeted designs in terms of global-local dual information processing and model structure for heterogeneous multi-agent, making it effectively considers the collaboration among heterogeneous agents and the long-term impact of current decisions. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on the rich simulation data. In comparison to the baseline algorithms, namely Greedy-SC-RP and MANF-DNN-RP, MANF-RL-RP has exhibited a significant performance improvement. Compared to MANF-DNN-RP and Greedy-SC-RP, the task completion rate based on MANF-RL-RP increased by an average of 8.82\% and 56.8\%, respectively.},

Recognizing the breadth of this year's program, we are publishing two sets of proceedings: one dedicated to research track papers, the Web4Good track, and keynotes; and a companion proceedings featuring the Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, and History of Web sessions. Through this rich assortment of activities, we aim to foster a vibrant community where delegates can share ideas, forge collaborations, and cultivate a sustainable, inclusive environment.Marking its 34th edition, WWW'25 welcomes more than 1,000 industry and academic experts eager to shape the future of Web technologies and applications. The conference logo, depicting the Sydney Harbour Bridge, symbolizes the Web's key function of "connecting" people and information. Originally founded at CERN in 1994 as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), this event has long been the leading venue for research, development, standards, and applications related to the Web.Over the years, WWW has introduced important breakthroughs, from The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998-which heralded Google-to the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. In the period between 2024 and 2025, large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced countless industries and everyday life, prompting fundamental shifts in the Web ecosystem. We anticipate that the research and discussions at this year's conference will spark further breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.Continuing the tradition of depth and diversity, WWW'25 accepted 26 workshops and 20 tutorials as pre-conference events. In addition, consistent with previous editions, we feature a Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, History of Web sessions, and Artifact Badging. Some of these are incorporated into the main conference schedule to encourage communication and collaboration among attendees.A commitment to diversity is pivotal to fostering robust, sustainable Web technologies. Our Web4Good track highlights how Web-based tools can address societal challenges, while the Industry Track showcases novel and impactful results from the industrial sector. This year, we have also launched an Emerging World Track to broaden participation from developing countries, as well as a competition track to enhance industry engagement..Organizing WWW'25 has been a true team effort. We sincerely thank the authors who contributed their work, and we extend our gratitude to the program and senior program committees for their dedication to reviewing submissions and offering feedback. We also appreciate the many additional chairs whose efforts ensured that each element of the program ran smoothly. Together, they have helped this conference continue to grow into a premier event for the Web research community.Finally, we would like to thank ACM SIGWEB and our industry sponsors-Meta, Huawei, Google, Baidu, Taobao, JD, and Infinigence-for their generous support, as well as our local government sponsors, Business Event Sydney and the NSW Government. We are equally grateful to our academic partner, the University of Technology Sydney, and the PCO company, ICMSA, for their indispensable help with registration, venue logistics, and social events. Their collective contributions have made the 2025 edition of this conference a resounding success.},

abstract = {We are delighted to welcome you to Melbourne, Australia for ACM Multimedia 2024, the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and its surrounding regions.},

abstract = {It is with great enthusiasm that we, on behalf of the Organizing Committee, invite you to join us for the 31st ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), a premier security and privacy conference where researchers, practitioners, and educators come together to present, learn, and debate research, innovation, and trends in the field of Computer and Communications Security and Privacy.This year, we are proud to introduce our conference theme to be "Inclusion, Mentorship, Community." These three pillars reflect our collective commitment to fostering a vibrant, supportive, and forwardthinking environment within the CCS community. Particularly, we host our inaugural Doctoral Symposium, which offers PhD students a unique platform to receive timely, constructive feedback on their dissertation research from leading experts in our community. Additionally, our first-ever Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Workshop is designed to cultivate a culture that embraces diversity and champions equity in our field. Moreover, understanding the importance of guidance and support, we have organized panels focusing on Student Mentoring, Faculty Mentoring, and Public Service. These panels are designed to facilitate mentorship connections, share valuable experiences, and encourage service that extends the impact of our work beyond academia. These new initiatives are also opportunities to strengthen the bonds within our CCS community.Regarding the main conference, this year's main conference is our largest ever, featuring 328 paper presentations that showcase the latest research and developments in our field. We are also honored to have two distinguished keynote speakers: Dr. Dan Boneh and Dr. Gene Tsudik, who will share their invaluable insights and perspectives on pressing topics in security and privacy. Additionally, 18 specialized workshops will take place on the pre-conference and post-conference days, providing platforms for focused discussions and collaborations on numerous specialized topics.},
