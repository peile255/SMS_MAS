Scaling the Metaverse: An AI Perspective,"When one hears the word Metaverse, it is automatically associated with millions of users, immersive experiences and its potential to change our lives. But, what enables the Metaverse to function at such a scale? This talk will present the different challenges associated with handling 55 million daily users within the Roblox Metaverse. From addressing user Quality of Experience, to distributed architecture, programming model and scheduling, we will cover the entire stack underneath. In particular, I will put special attention into the AI-Metaverse relationship. On one hand, a large proportion of workloads are based on one or multiple ML/DL models and I will present the challenges of scaling them. On the other hand, I will explore infrastructure and service model challenges that can be addressed with AI, e.g. multi-resource and multi-datacenter scheduling with Reinforcement learning.","data center, metaverse, reinforcement learning, resource optimization"
User Recommendation in Social Metaverse with VR,"Social metaverse with VR has been viewed as a paradigm shift for social media. However, most traditional VR social platforms ignore emerging characteristics in a metaverse, thereby failing to boost user satisfaction. In this paper, we explore a scenario of socializing in metaverse with VR, which brings major advantages over conventional social media: 1) leverage flexible display of users' 360-degree viewports to satisfy individual user interests, 2) ensure the user feelings of co-existence, 3) prevent view obstruction to help users find friends in crowds, and 4) support socializing with digital twins. Therefore, we formulate the Co-presence, and Occlusion-aware Metaverse User Recommendation (COMUR) problem to recommend a set of rendered players for users in social metaverse with VR. We prove COMUR is an NP-hard optimization problem and design a dual-module deep graph learning framework (COMURNet) to recommend appropriate users for viewport display. Experimental results on real social metaverse datasets and a user study with Occulus Quest 2 manifest that the proposed model outperforms baseline approaches by at least 36.7\% of solution quality.","virtual reality, social metaverse, friend recommendation"
Foundations for Grassroots Democratic Metaverse,"While the physical lives of many of us are in democracies (one person, one vote - e.g., the EU and the US), our digital lives are mostly in autocracies (one person, all votes - e.g., Facebook). Cryptocurrencies promise liberation but stop short, at plutocracy (one coin, one vote). What would it take for us to live in a digital democracy? This paper offers a vision, a theoretical framework, and an architecture for a grassroots network of autonomous, people-owned, people-operated, and people-governed digital communities, namely a grassroots democratic metaverse. It also charts a roadmap towards realizing it, and identifies unexplored territory for MAS research.","sybil resilience, social choice, personal and community cryptocurrency, on-chain governance, grassroots protocol stack, grassroots cryptoeconomy, digital social contracts, digital democracy, democratic DAO, blockchain"
Finding Effective Ad Allocations: How to Exploit User History,"A primary source of revenue for web platforms is digital advertising. Platforms typically maximize the effectiveness of advertising campaigns by exploiting user features (i.e., targeted advertising). However, performance can be further improved by leveraging user navigation history. In particular, the advent of new augmented reality platforms encourages users to spend a considerable amount of time in the same virtual environment, opening up the challenge of determining which ads to display and at which time of their experience. In this paper, we initiate the study of history-dependent advertising by providing a user model and optimized ad allocation algorithms. Our model assumes that users move through a series of scenes where they are exposed to ads. The performance of an ad may be influenced by various factors, such as the features of the scene in which it is displayed, the externalities of previously observed ads and the possibility that a user has already purchased the promoted product. We analyze the computational complexity of finding an optimal ad allocation for several model flavors and provide practical approximation algorithms with tight theoretical guarantees. We also discuss under which conditions our approximation algorithms are monotone according to Myerson's definition, thus leading to truthful auction mechanisms.","ad allocation, algorithmic advertising, mechanism design"
Distributed Mechanism Design in Social Networks,"Designing auctions to incentivize buyers to invite new buyers via their social connections is a new trend in mechanism design[18]. The challenge is that buyers are competitors and we need to design proper incentives for them to invite each other. For selling a single item, many interesting mechanisms have been proposed. However, all the mechanisms require the seller or a third party to be trustworthy to execute the mechanisms. In addition, the owner of the mechanism will know all the connections of the network after the execution, which poses a potential privacy issue. Hence, distributed mechanisms to avoid the privacy issue are more appealing in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first distributed mechanism in social networks without revealing buyers' private connections to anyone, and it achieves complete decentralization that does not rely on any trustworthy third party. Moreover, the centralized reduction of our mechanism also offers a novel way to compute players' contributions compared to the existing solutions.","distributed mechanism design, invitation incentive, social network"
Agent-Assisted Life-Long Education and Learning,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to education and learning, in which digital agents take care of the life-long education and career development of their human partners. Agent consults requirements and preferences and proactively searches for opportunities by monitoring job markets, reflecting on educational options and challenges. Then, it adjusts the current academic program and coordinates the pathway facilitating the optimal desired outcome. We envision a Distributed Educational Agent Network (DEAN) of connected, trustworthy educational agents that securely communicate with each other to collectively carry out the above-mentioned tasks. We discuss the benefits and current and future challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed agent-assisted educational approach. Research and development of DEAN provide a unique opportunity for the agent community to design, implement and evaluate agent technologies in complex, large scale scenarios. In this paper, we also specify a proposal for a design of a DEAN agent, using skill development to monitor and drive education and career.","precision education, human-agent interaction, distributed agent marketplaces, agent-supported learning"
Modeling spatial-temporal context information in virtual worlds,"Currently, we use many definitions with diffuse boundaries: Web 2.0 (Social Networks), Web 3.0 (Semantic Web), Web 3D (Metaverses, Virtual Worlds, Mirror Worlds), Recommendation Systems, Augmented Reality, Geo-location... In this paper we explore the possibilities of the combined use of these concepts, we introduce the concept of VARD (Virtual Augmented Reality Device) and show interoperability between recommendation systems and Virtual Worlds. We have developed a Recommendation System which have two ways of interaction with the virtual world of Second Life in connection with context spatial-temporal information: an active recommendation system, called TESLAR, that interacts with avatars by a 2D HUD VARD object, and a passive and automatic recommendation system, called MarvinBot, that interacts with avatars by a Metabot VARD.","virtual worlds, second life, recommendation systems, multiagent systems, mirror worlds, metaverses, metabots, intelligent agents, context information, augmented reality"
ColSLAM: A Versatile Collaborative SLAM System for Mobile Phones Using Point-Line Features and Map Caching,"Over the past years, augmented reality (AR) based on mobile phones has gained great attention. When multiple phones are used in AR applications, collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is considered one of the enabling technologies, i.e., multiple mobile phones complete the localization and mapping through collaboration. However, the state-of-the-art collaborative SLAM systems not only suffer from the delays introduced by a high-complexity graph optimization problem, but also may exhibit varying levels of accuracy across dissimilar environments or different types of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a scalable and robust collaborative SLAM system, point-line-based Collaborative SLAM (ColSLAM). Technically, ColSLAM includes two innovative features that help achieve satisfactory scalability and robustness. First, a mapping cacher (MC) is designed for each agent on the server, which uses global keyframes to detect loop closures, updates the cached local map, and quickly responds to the agent's pose drifts. With MC, each agent's local pose is corrected using global knowledge in real-time. Secondly, to improve the robustness performance, ColSLAM employs point-line-fusion-based Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO), point-line-fusion-based NetVLAD loop detection, and an enhanced geometric verification and relative pose calculation method called PNPL. Empirical evaluations based on the EuRoc dataset and real degenerate environments demonstrate that ColSLAM outperforms the existing collaborative SLAM systems in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability.","augmented reality, collaborative slam, map caching, mobile phones, multi-agent, point-line features"
