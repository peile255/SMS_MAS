"Scene graph adapter: an efficient architecture to improve interoperability between 3D formats and 3D applications engines","We present a generic architecture which enables the loading of several 3D formats in most 3D application engines. The purpose of this work is to solve the interoperability issue among 3D formats raised by the multiplicity of formats. We propose a programming interface, the Scene Graph Adapter, that allows mixing several 3D formats in a single application without transcoding. The Scene Graph Adapter is composed of two API; a first one that wraps each 3D format and a second one that wraps rendering engines. Wrappers created thanks to these API can be reused in other applications based on the Scene Graph Adapter. The paper introduces our approach and gives an implementation example.","web3D, virtual worlds, software architecture, rendering, interoperability, 3D format"
